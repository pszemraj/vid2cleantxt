OH YA I'M SORRY AND NOW MAA MY BEST DAY TO DAY YA WHAT WHAT DIN I DO I OK I MUST BE DRUNK TO DAY
 THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY MORE MISTAKE O K FORTUNATELY NOT RIGHT OK VERY GOOD SI SO SO A LET ME TO THIS AGAIN SO NOW I CAN MODIFY
 WAVE EQUATION RIGHT ORIGINALLY THE WAVE EQUATION IS PART SQUARE SIDE PART T SQUARE EQUAL TO V SQUARE PARS SQUARE SIDE PAR X SQUARE AND NOW I ADD ADDITIONAL TURN QICH SATO TE
 PROPORTIONAL TO THE A A PATE SQUARE PATE TO THE FOR SIDE PAT X TO THE FORT O IF I HAD THIS TURN INTO AGAIN AND NOW I PRAG IN THE WAFY QUESTION THE PROGRESSING WAVE
 SOLUTION INTO THE SEQUENC EQUATION THEN I WILL GET THIS FORMULA O SO NOW EVERYTHING SHOULD BE CORRECT AND I HAVE CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT EVERYBODY IS FOLLOWING SO THAT IS VERY GOOD AND THE
 I CAN NOW CANCEL ALL THE MINOR SIGN IN THEN THIS BECOME PRASS AND NOW I CAN A O CALCULA WA BE THE THE SPEDOFA PROPAGATION FOR THIS SPECIFIC HARMONIC POCESING WAVE AND THE
 MAK OU K WILL BE EQUAL TO V SQUARE DOTO ONE PROS ALFA K SQUARE I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE CONTRIBUTION ANDTH NOW WE SEE THAT CLEARLY THIS RATIO DEPENDS ON K
 I SO IF I PRAT THIS ANTOP OF THE PREVIOUS CUP WHICH I SATA OPTAINTE FRANC FRON HERE OK THEN WHAT I AM GOING TO GET IS SOMETHING LIKE THIS
 THE BEGINNING IS VERY CLOSE TO THE NON DISPERSIVE CASE AND THER IT GOES UP BECAUSE BECAUSE OF THISAFA CONTRIBUTION AF ITU A POSITIVE NUMBER IN MY MYMADO
 AND THE K ESSATALBE A THE A THE WEIGHT NUMBER OK SO WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IS THAT BASTY AFTER YOU INCRUSE THE STEEPNESS THE SLOPE OF THIS CURVE IS CA
 DIN AS A FUNCTIONAL K OK A WHAT WILL I LEARN FROM THIS EXERCISE IS THAT IF I INQUISE K OK IF I HAVE A VERY LARGE K
 OK THAT MEANS I HAVE A VERY SMALL LANDA BECAUSE K SA SHO BE TOO PI OVER LANDA OK SO THAT MEANS IAIN'T LOOKING AT SOMETHING REALY REALLY STOR DISTORTED LIKE THIS
 OK BOSRING TENSION AND THE STIFFNESS WANTS TO RESTORE OK RESTORE THE STRING BACK TO NOMA THEREFORE WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THAT
 ARE GOING TO GET ADDITIONAL RESTORED IN FORCE THEREFORE AS WE AS ELY A CALCULATE HERE IF AFA IS ASII POSITIVE THEN THE VELOCITY ASO
 CREASED WITH RESPECT TO WHAT TOULD BE ER ER WHAT WE A TO GET BEFORE WE WE ACTUL AD THIS INTO THE MAT OK SO I THINK THA'LL MAKE SENSE RIGHT BECAUSE THE STIFEESS ALSO WANTS TO RESTORE THE
 THE DISTORTION THEREFORE YOU HAVE LARGER AND LARGER A A RESTORING FORCE THEREFORE THE SPEED OF PROPOGATION OF THIS HARMONIC WAVE WILL INCREASE OK SO THAT'S PRETTY NICE
 BUT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO OUR PROJECT OCAS OUR PROJECT IS TO SEND INFORMATION FROM ONE PLACE TO THE OTHER PLACE RIGHT SO WHAT WE JUST DISCUSS BE IS THAT
 WE CAN AS WE SEND A SQUARE HOUSE AND A LADE PROPA OK A SQUARE POUSE CAN BE DECOMPOSED INTO MANY MANY PIECES MANY MANY HARMONIC WAVES OK BEFORE
 THE SQUARE POUS WORKS BECAUSE ALL THE WAVES WITH DIFFERENT WAVE LANDS A POKEA UP A POGEA ASTHEO MOVING AT THIS CONSTANT SPEED T INDEPENDENT OF THEWAVE
 LES NOW WE ARE IN TROUBLE AS YOU CAN SEE HERE THAT NOW THE SPEED WHICH IS OMEGABAG DEPENDS ON THE WAVE NUMBER OR WAVELETS THE
 FOR DIFFERENT COMPONENTS WHICH ASDY ARE NEEDED TO CREATE A SQUARE HOUSE ARE GOING TO BE PROPAGATING AT DIFFERENT SPEED YOU CAN SAY OH COME ON THIS IS A MATHEMATICS WHY I DON'T BELIEVE
 OU YOU KNOW A SQUARE POUS IS FOR SQUARE POUSE AND TAS MATHEMATICS LAS MANS DEPARTMENT BUT WE CAN ASREALLY SEE THAT IN THE EXPERIMENT O K SO THAT'S TAKE A LOOK AT THIS DEMONSTRATION MAYBE
 DIDN'T NOTICE THAT BEFORE BUT WE HAVE SEEN THIS ENFACT FROM HER PREVIOUS LECTURES A CASE OF I CAN NOW QUI A A SQUARE NOT NOT REALY SQUARE PASS BUT AS WI SOME KIND OF POUS I CAN QUI A
 SOME KIND OF POWS LIKE THIS OK AND E AS WE LEARNED BEFORE I WHEN THISE POWS PASS THROUGH A OPEN AND I'S GOING TO BE BOUNCED ABACKI SO THEREFORE I CAN HAVE A DIMIT OK I CAN AT
 SHOW YOU THIS DAMO IN A DIMITY TO AA SET UP AT THIS POUSE IS GOING TO BE GOING BACK AND FORTH BECAUSE I HAVE OPENED AND OK AS WE DISCUSSED BEFORE OK WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IS THAT SINCE WE HAVE A REALIS
 REALISTIC ASSISTENT WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IS THAT THIS POWS WILL BECOME WIDER AND WIDER RIGHT THAT'S THE PREDICTION COMING FROM A THISEQUATION DIFFERENT COMPONENT WITH
 ENT WAVE LANDS IS GOING TO BE PROPAGATING AT DIFFERENT SPEED THEREFORE THIS POUSE IS GOING TO BECOME WIDER AND WE CAN SEE THAT OK SO DAME QUICKLY PRODUCE A POUSE AND SEE WHAT WILL HAPPEN O K
 ORIGINALLY ESENTALLY REALLY SHARP AND YOU CAN SEE THAT REALLY THEWIS OF THE POUS BECOME WIDER AND WIDER AND AT THE SAME POINT IT DISAPPEAR OK IF I HAVE A BER
 SETAT WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO SEE IS THAT IT'S GOING TO BE PROPAGATING A TOWARD THE SAN DIACTION AND THE WHIZ OF THE POWS ISASAY GOING TO BE INCREASING AS A FUNCTIONA TIME DUSYOU TAKE A LOOK
 THIS AGAIN NOW THIS TIME YOU HAVE A NEGATIVE POWERS YOU SORT OF SEE VERY SIMILAR THING AND ALSO YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE SOUNDS STRANGE VIBRATION AS SHOU DID LAG BEHIND TET THE MAN POWS IT
 STHAT MEANS DIFFERENT NO DI HARMONIC WAYS WICH DIFFERENT WIT LANDS REALLY AE PROVE PROPAGATING AT DIFFERENT SPEED AND FOR THAT TO TE
 STRATE THIS EFFECT I ALSO PREPARED SOME DEMONSTRATION WHICH WASUTE ER A PASE ON OU CALCULATION OK SO YOU CAN SAY THAT OK NOW I AM CONVINCED I I CAN SEE E
 DISPERSION IN THE EXPERIMENT HOW DO I KNOW THIS CALCULATION AS TO MATCH WITH EXPERIMENTAL DATA RIGHT HOW ABOUT WE REALLY ER PUT A WRONG ASSIMULATION AND SEE WHAT HAPPEN OK SO WHAT THIS ER WHAT
 IS EXPAND POA YO DO IS IN THE INTHER BEGINNING OK YO WOULD DO INDIGRATION LIKE CRAZY OK IN ORDER TO GET ALL THE COMPONENTS QUE CALCULATED LAND IS GOING TO PROPAGATE ALL THOSE PARTS
 ALTHOUGH TIFF APOSTIFE TO HIS DIFFERENT COMPONENT THROUGH THE MEDIUM O AND THAT THERE WOULD BE TWO DIFFERENT COLORS ONE ISENTIALLY BRUE WHICH IS THE ORIGINAL SHAPE THE OTHER ONE IS ACTUALLY THE ONE WHIIS STEEPE
 IS TURNED OUT OK SO NOW IN THE BEGINNING I CAN SET THE AFA VALUE TO B POINT O TWO AND SEE WHAT WILL HAPPEN AND I WILL PRODUCE A TRIANGULAR PAUSE OK YOU CAN SEE THAT NOW THE PROGRAM
 REALLY WORKING VERY HARD TO CALCULATE ALLTHE COMPONENTS OCA FROM ONE TO ONE NINETY NINE AND EQUAL TO ONE NINETY NINE AND NOW THIS INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS ARE PROPAGATING THROUG
 THE MEDIUM AND YOU CAN SEE THAT ORIGINALLY THE SHAPE IS LIKE A A LABRU A A SHAPE A TRIANGULAR SHAPE AND YOU CAN SEE THAT IS A FUNCTIONAL TINE THE PALS BECOME WIDER AND WIDER
 NOW OF COURSE I CAN INCREASE THE AFA TWO POINT O TWO AND SEE WHAT L HAPPEN FROMPOINT O TWO TWO POINT TWO AND SEE WHAT HAPPEN YOU SHOULD EXPECT A MUCH LARGER DISPERSION AND YOU CAN
 SEE THAT NOW IN THE BEGINNING TOING TE INDIGRATION AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS TIME BECAUSE H AFI SAYS YOU LARGER THEREFORE YOU SEE THAT THIS EFFECT SES THIS BROADENINGIS
 HAPPENING EARLIER AND THA BECOME BROADER AND BROADER AND THAT THEY ARE A LOT OF STRANGER STRUCTURES AS YOU CAN SEE ALSO FROM THE TEMO ARE PRODUCED BECAUSE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS ARE AS SOUBE PROPAGATED AT DIFFERENT SPEED
 OK SO OF COURSE WE ARE AN IT SO IN THIS COURSE WE HAVE AN ITE AN IT WAVES RIGHT SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE NIT WAVE AND SEE WHAT I HAPPEN NOW YOU SEE THAT LE
 VERY SHARP GE WHICH I SHOULD REQUIRE REALLY A LOT OF EFFORT TO REPRODUCE THAT AND YOU CAN SEE THAT AH AN ITS KIND OF DISTORTED A A BUNK N TINE O CAN KIND OF STILL IDENTIFY THE PEAK
 BUTSASOULDE NOT DISPRAISED AND IN THE END OF THE SIMULATION YOU CANNOT SEE EVEN RECOGNIZE TATA TO THE ORIGIN OF THENIT SIGNAL WHICH YOU SENT FROM YOUR SOURCE OK
 SO WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS THAT AH THIS EFFECT THIS DISPERSION IF THAT IS REALLY ENEMY WHICH IS ASUALLY VERY DANGEROUS AND NOW I ISY WILL PREVENT US FROM
 SCENTING A HIGH QUALITY SIGNALS EH OK ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT OLOSTEMOS
 A SO SO THISIS BECAUSE O A A THE STEEPNESS A YO SSETIA SYMETRIC RIT OR IF YOU IF YOU PEN THIS THING IF YOU PENDE THE STRING THEN THEYARE
 SION FROM THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE PART OK IF YOU HAVE A TEN TO THE IF YOU HAVE A PART TO THE THREE PART TO THE X TO THE THREE COMPOMNENT THEN TIS IS GOING TO BE A SYMETRIC AND SUGEST AGAINST OUR PHYSICS INTUITION AND ALS
 IN THE INDISA MATODING YOU ALSO MATCH WITH OUR EXPERIMENTAL DATA PRETTY WELL VERY GOOD QUESTION AND ON THE OTHER HAND WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE STIEPNESS OK YOU CAN ALSO GO BACK TO THE
 INFINITE NUMBER COUPLED ISILATEE CASE IF YOU INSTAD A TAKE A EXAMPLE WHICH YOU SAY SO NOT SUPER SMALL ERE DISPLACEMENT OF POCIMATION YOU TAKE THE
 EXTO NEXT THE TO TEDING OTER TURN THEN YOU SEE THAT THE PARTIAL TO THE THREE PASS YOR AX TO THE THREE TURN AS YOU CAN SO BECAUSE IS SYMMETRIC SO I ARGUED AND THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO ALSO OBTAIN THIS TURN
 WHEN YOU HAVE SLIGHTLY LARGER A DISPLAISEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE EQUILIBRIUM POSITION O K SO I HOPE THI'LL ANSWER YOUR QUESTION ANY OTHER QUESTION YES
 OTAPO WHEN YOU PASS THROUGH THE MEDIUM E MONACAS YOU CHANGE THE SPEED OF A A DIFFERENT A WIT LANC
 SHE TEMPERATELY RE VERY GOOD QUESTION O K SO VERY GOOD TAT WE WE GOT TWO QUESTIONS AND WE CAN SEE THAT IF I NOW TURN ON THE AFA MAKE THE AF ABOUT YOU LARGE THEN YOU CAN SEE THATE
 INFORMATION IS DISTORTED O AND THIS INVOLVE INFINITE NUMBER OF COUNTRY OF TERNS AND THAT IN THIS CASE IN THIS NEW TIMO WHICH I SHOW HERE I HAVE HALFA VALUE EQUAL TO POINT TWO THEREFORE THE
 EFFECT OF A DISPERSE A DIS DISPERSION IA SHOULD BE MUCH LARGER THAN WHAT YOU SHOWD BEFORE AND THEN YOU CAN SEE THAT IS ANIGHTY WAVE QUICKDIP YOU COME O SOMETHING LIKE A COUSON LIKE WAVE OK O K SO VERY
 GOOD SO A SO YOU CAN SAY O K A YOU ARE MAKING A EXAMPLE WHICH I O K MAYBE ITS SAVERY INTERESTING EXAMPLE BUT YOU INVOLVE TOO MANY TURNS YOU HAVE INFINITE NUMBER OF
 PROGRESSING WAFES IN IN THIS EXAMPLE OK IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND HOW ABOUT WE GO BACK TO A MUCH SIMPLER EXAMPLE O K WHAT WELL WE CAN DO
 IS THAT INSTEAD OF YOU KNOW GOING THROUGH INFINITE NUMBER OF HARMONIC WAVES NOW WE JUST CONSIDER TWO WAVES AND TE OVERLAP THESE TWO WAVES TOGETHER AND SEE
 HAPPEN OK AND I SEE WHAT WE CAN LEARN FROM IT BECAUSE THEE THE ER YOU KNOW THET REQUIRED NUMBER OF A HAMINKA WAV TO DESCRIBE SUCH POSIS TO COMPLICATE SO YOU CAN SAY THAT O K NOW
 LETS JUST CONSIDER TWO WAVES AND SEE WHAT WE CAN LEARN FROM THIS AND THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I AM GOING TO DO NOW SO FROM POLE'S LECTURE I HOPE HE COVERED THE PIT PHENOMENA SUPASILY WHAT IS IT EBIT PHENOMENA
 BIT PHENOMENA HAPPENS WHEN YOU OVERLAP TWO ER WAVES TWO HARMONIC WAVES THEY HAVE PRETTY CLOSE ER ER ER WAVE LANDS OK BUT DON ANOTHER SET OK
 AND NOW IF YOU ADD TWO WAVES TOGETHER THAT'S ATY WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO GET YOU ARE GOING TO GET A SOMETHING WHICH IS OSSOLATING REALLY REALY FAST WHICH YOU SAY SHE CALLED A CARRIER OK ANDA ALSO YOU CAN
 THAT THE MAGNITUDE OF THE ISCELLATION IS SADTOE CHANGEIN AS THE FUNCTION OF POSITION AND THAT WE CALL IT ENVELOPE OC SO THAT ISSAO TEPET PHENOMENA WHICH WE LEARN FROM PERIOD LECTURES SOIN
 EXAMPLE I AM GOING TO ADD A TWO WAVES TOGETHER SO THE FIRST WAVE AS DESCRIBED BY SOKA IS DENOTED BY SI ONE
 THE FUNCTIONO X AND D AND E HAS THE FUNCTION OF FORM A IS THE MPRT AND THE SIGN K ONE X MINUS OMEGA T OMACA ON T HOK TI
 A PROGRESSING WAVE PROPAGATING TOWARD THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE BOARD THE POSITIVE DIRECTION OF THE X AXIS IN MY COORDINATE SYSTEN AND E HAS A WAVE NUMBER K ONE AND THE ANG
 QUENCY IL MAKE OUT WHAT OK AND I CAN ALSO WRITE DOWN MY SECOND WAVE WHICH I WOULD LIKE TO OVERLAP WITH THE FIRST WAVE IT SO DISITY HAVING EXACTLY THE SANE AMPIT WHICH I A AND IT
 DESCRIBED BY A SILENT FUNCTION AND YOU HAVE A WITH NUMBER K TWO X MINUS OMEGA TWO T ANGE FREQUENCY OMICA TWO OK WITH THIS
 TWO EQUATIONS WE CAN CALCULATE T THE SPEED OF PROVOGATION FOR THE INDIVIDUAL WAVES RIGHT SO THE FIRST ONE I CAN CALCULATE THE SPEED OF PROPAGATION WE ONE WILL BE EQUAL TO OMEGA ONE
 VERONE VERY SIMILARLY YOU CAN ALSO CALCULATE THE SPEED OF PROPAGATION FOR THE SECOND WAVE WHICH HOMAGA TO OVER TWO OK SO NOW WHAT I AM GOING TO DO IS TO
 LAT THE SON OF THESE TWO WAVES S I HAVE THE TOTAL IF WIC O SA I SQA TO SI ONE AS SI OK SO WHAT I AM GOING TO DO IS TO OVERLAP THESE TWO WAVES AND SEE WHAT HAPPEN
 FOR THAT I NEED THIS FORMULA WHICH IS A SIGN A PLUS SIGN B AND THIS WILL BE EQUAL TO TWO TIMES SIGN A PRAS B
 OE TWO AND SIGN BECOME COSSIGN HERE COSIGN A MINUS B TWO OK SO IF I USED THAT FORMULLERO
 PASILY WHAT I AM GOING TO GET IS WE HAVE TWO TIMES FON A FORMULAR SO WE HAVE TWO A OK SIGN ONE POSK TWO
 X MINUS OMEGA ONE PLUS OMEGA TWO TWOT SOPESILY THE FIRST TURN IS THE ASINE FUNCTION THE SECON FUNCTION AND THE CONTEN
 A PROSPE THEREFORE YOU ADD THESE TWO TOGETHER RIGHT DIVIDED BY TWO THENBESIDY THIS IS ATAR YOU AP TEN OK THE SECOND TURN IS A CONSIGN TURN YOU GET A CONSIGN HERE
 BUT NOW YOU CALCULATE A MINUS B WHICH IS THIS THIS TERM MINUS TOTERN DIVIDED BY TWO THEN BET E T WHAT YOU GET IS K ONE MINUS K TWO DIVIDED BY TWO MINUS X MINUS OR MAK
 ONE MAN SOMMING AT TWO O TWO OK SO TAT TI SAY YOU TE WHAT WOULL HAPPEN IF YOU ADD THESE TWO A WAVES TOGETHER OK
 UNTIL NOW EVERYTHING IS EXACT AND I WOULD LIKE TO ADD ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS OR ADDITIONAL ASSUMPTIONS WHEN I DISCUSS THIS SOLUTION O SO HOW ABOUT
 IN ORDER TO PRODUCE THE BIT PHENOMENA I NEED TO MAKE THE
