N ISN'T AN INITER AND IN THE CLASS OF BUTTERWORTH FILTERS TO GENERATE A RATIONAL TRANSFER FUNCTION CAPITAL N THIS BEROMETER MUST BE AN INITER SO SINCE IT CAN'T BE FIVE POINT EIGHT EIGHT
 THE NATURAL THING TO DO IS TO MOVE IT UP TO THE NEXT CLOSEST INTEGER NAMELY SIX AND THAT MEANS THAT IT WILL END UP WITH A FILTER THAT DOES EVEN BETTER THAN THE SPECIFICATIONS ON THE OTHER
 AND THERE'S SOMETHING KIND OF UNDERNEATH THE SURFACE THAT IS INHERENT IN THE IMPULSE AND VARIANT DESIGN PROCEDURE NAMELY THE FACT THAT THERE WILL ALWAYS BE SOME ALIASING SO ONE STRATEGY AND A NATURAL
 OFTEN IN IMPULSE AND VARIANT DESIGN IS TO CHOOSE N AS THE NEXT HIGHEST INTEGURE AS I'VE DONE AND THEN CHOOSE THE PARIMETER OMEGUS OF C SO THAT
 PASS BAND SPECIFICATIONS ARE EXACTLY MET AND THE STOP BAND SPECIFICATIONS ARE THEN SLIGHTLY EXCEEDED AND THAT WILL LEAVE SOME MARGIN FOR ALIUSING RIGHT NOW CONTINUING THIS
 EXAMPLE THEN HOW WOULD WE COMPLETE THE DESIGN WELL WE KNOW WHAT OUR TWO PAROMETERS CAPITAL N AND OMEGUS OF C ARE
 THAT MEANS THAT WE CAN DETERMINE B OF S TIMES B OF MINUS S THOSE POLES ARE LOCATED ON A CIRCLE IN THE COMPLEX S PLANE AND THE POLES ON THAT CIRCLE ARE PAIR
 SOME BEING ASSOCIATED WITH B OF S AND SOME WITH B OF MINUS S AND IN PARTICULAR TO DETERMINE B OF S WE WOULD SIMPLY TAKE THE POLES ON THE PORTION OF THE CIRCLE THAT
 IN THE LEFT HALF OF THE ESPLANE NOW WHAT THAT GIVES US IS A BUTTERWORTH CONTINUOUS TIME FILTER WHICH WE ARE THEN MAP
 ING THROUGH IMPULSE AND VARIANCE WITH CAPITAL T EQUAL TO ONE TO A DISCREET TIME FILTER THAT DISCREET TIME FILTER TO BE USED IN A SYSTEM WHICH HAS AN ASSOCIATED SAMPLING FREQUENCY
 WHICH IS TEN KILLEHURTS SO TO GET THE DISCREET TIME FILTER THEN WE FIRST DETERMINED B OF S AS WE JUST DID OR AT LEAST I INDICATED HOW TO DO IT WE WOULD
 THEN EXPAND THAT OUT IN A PARTIAL FRACTION EXPANSION AND THEN APPLY THE IMPULSE AND VARIANT PROCEDURE WHICH CONSISTS OF MAPPING THE POLES IN THE SPLANE TO POLES
 HE Z PLANE AT LOCATIONS E TO THE S OF K CAPITAL T HERE CAPITAL T IS EQUAL TO ONE AND RETAINING THE RESIDUE OR THE COEFFICIENT IN THE EXPANSION AND THIS THEN WILL GIVE US THE TRANSFER FUNCT
 ANFOR THE DISCREET TIME FILTER SO IF IN FACT WE DID THAT THEN THE RESULTING FREQUENCY RESPONSE THAT WE WOULD GET IS WHAT I'V
 TED HERE AND I INDICATED FIRST ON A MAGNITUDE SCALE LINEAR MAGNITUDE SCALE AND SECOND ON A LOGARITHMIC SCALE AND AS WE HAD ORIGINALLY SPECIFIED THE
 A FILTER IS SUPPOSED TO BE GREATER THAN AREQUAL TO MINUS ONE D B AT POINT TWO PI AND LESS THAN AREQUAL TO MINUS FIFTEEN D B AT POINT THREE PI AND IN FACT
 THIS SLIGHTLY EXCEEDS THOSE SPECIFICATIONS SINCE WE HAD PURPOSELY ALLOWED SOME MARGIN IN THE STOPPAN NOW THIS IS
 ILLUSTRATION OF THE IMPULSE AND VARIANT PROCEDURE AND IT HAS A NUMBER OF VERY NICE PROPERTIES ONE OF WHICH IS THAT IT TAKES A CONTINUOUS TIME FILTER FREQUENCY RESPONSE AND IT CONVERTS IT TO
 A DISCREET TIME FREQUENCY RESPONSE WHICH IN THE ABSENCE OF ALIASING LOOKS IDENTICAL EXCEPT FOR A LINEAR FREQUENCY SCALE CHANGE AND IN FACT IF WE PICK CAPITAL T EQUAL TO ONE THEN THERE IS NO SCALE CHANGE IT HAS THE MAJOR DISADVANTAGE
 THAT THERE IS ALWAYS ALIASING AND FOR SOME DESIGN FOR SOME PROBLEMS FOR EXAMPLE IF THE FILTER THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DESIGN IS NOT BAN LIMITED OR LOWPAS THEN THE ALIESING
 WILL NATURALLY BECOME INTOLERABLE WELL THERE'S ANOTHER DESIGNED PROCEDURE WHICH I NOW WANT TO INTRODUCE WHICH TOTALLY AVOIDS THE PROBLEMS OF ALISING BUT OBVIOUSLY THEN HAS ITS OWN COST ASSOCIATED
 AND THAT PROCEDURE IS REFERRED TO AS THE BILINEAR TRANSFORMATION THE BILINEAR TRANSFORMATION WHICH I WON'T TRY TO DERIVE HERE IN ANY DE
 IS A MAPPING OF CONTINUOUS TIME FILTERS TO DISCREET TIME FILTERS CORRESPONDING TO TAKING THE LAPLACE TRANSFORM VARIABLE S IN THE CONTINUOUS TIME FILT
 AND REPLACING IT BY WHAT IS REFERRED TO AS A BILINEAR FUNCTION OF Z AND SO IF I SUBSTITUTE THIS IN HERE THAT WILL GIVE ME THE DISCREET TIME FREQUENCY
 ONSE AGAIN IN THIS PROCEDURE THERE IS A PAROMETER CAPITAL T WHICH AGAIN IS TOTALLY IRRELEVANT GIVEN THE APPROACH THAT WE'RE TAKING AND WHICH WE WILL GENERALLY TEND TO NORMALIZE OUT TO UNITY AND LET ME JUST SAY QUICK
 AND IN PASSING THAT ALTHOUGH WE WON'T GO THROUGH THIS THE NOTION OF THE BIOLINEAR TRANSFORMATION CAN BE TIED TO THE CONCEPT OF TAKING THE DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION FOR
 CONTINUOUS TIME FILTER CONVERTING IT TO AN INTEGRAL EQUATION BY INTEGRATING ENOUGH TIMES ON BOTH SIDES AND THEN CONVERTING THAT TO A DIFFERENT EQUATION BY A
 MATING THE INTEGRALS WITH THE TRAPIZOIDAL RULE AND THAT IN EFFECT WILL CORRESPOND TO MAPPING THE CONTINUOUS TIME FILTER TO A DISCREET TIME FILTER WITH THE BILINEAR TRANSFORMATION WELL WE'LL JUST
 S ON THE PROPERTIES OF THE MAPPING AND IN PARTICULAR IF WE WERE TO SUBSTITUTE INTO THE EXPRESSION Z EQUAL TO ET OF THE GOMEGA CORRESPONDING TO THE UNIT CIRCLE
 WE WOULD FIND THAT THE UNIT CIRCLE IN DISCREETE TIME CORRESPONDS TO MAPPING THE GOMEGA AXIS IN CONTINUOUS TIME WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT WE WANT
 NOW THE MAPPING BETWEEN THE CONTINUOUS TIME FREQUENCY AND THE DISCRETE TIME FREQUENCY IS A NON LINEAR MAPPING WHICH IS GIVEN BY THE ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSION THAT I INDICATE
 ER AND IF WE PLOT THIS MAPPING WHAT WE HAVE IS THIS CURVE AND WHAT THIS CORRESPONDS TO THEN IS
 A MAPPING OF THE GOMEGA AXIS OR CONTINUOUS TIME FREQUENCY TO DISCREET TIME FREQUENCY AND IF WE THINK MORE GENERALLY OF THE MAPPING REPRESENTED BY THE VIOLINEAR TRANSFORM
 ON IN THE CONTEXT OF THE S PLANE AND THE Z PLANE IT CORRESPONDS TO MAPPING THE GOMEGA AXIS IN THE SPLANE TO ONCE AROUND THE UNIT CIRCLE IN THE Z PLANE
 AND YOU CAN ALSO CONVINCE YOURSELF THAT THE LEFT HALF OF THE SPLANE MAPS TO THE INSIDE OF THE UNIT CIRCLE AND SO THAT MEANS THAT STABLE CONTINUOUS TIME FILTERS WILL ALWAYS MAP
 TO STABLE DISCREET TIME FILTERS WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT WE DESIRE NOW NOTICE IN THIS THAT THERE'S NO ISSUE OF ALIAS IND WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THAT WE'VE REPLACED S BY A FUNCTION OF Z AND IT CORRESPONDS TO MAPPING THE
 PLANE TO THE ZPLANE IN FACT THE WHOLE JOMEGA AXIS HAS MAPPED TO ONCE AROUND THE UNIT CIRCLE WHICH OBVIOUSLY REQUIRES SOME TYPE OF NON LINEAR MAPPING BECAUSE LOOK THE
 OMEGA AXIS IS INFINITELY LONG THE UNIT CIRCLE HAS A FINITE RADIUS AND SO ESSENTIALLY WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN IS IF YOU THINK OF WALKING ALONG THE CONTINUOUS TIME FREQUENCY AXIS AND SIMULTANEOUSLY
 WALKING AROUND THE UNIT CIRCLE IF YOU WALK AT A CONSTANT RATE AROUND THE UNIT CIRCLE AND YOU'RE SIMULTANEOUSLY WALKING UP THE JOMEGA AXIS IF YOU WANT TO GET AROUND TO PI BY THE TIME HERE YOU'VE GOTTEN TO
 INFINITY ALONG THE CONTINUOUS TIME FREQUENCY AXIS YOU BETTER START WALKING FASTER AND FASTER AND FASTER BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT AN INFINITE DISTANCE TO COVER WHILE YOU JUST GO OVER A FINITE DISTANCE HERE
 WELL WHAT ALL THAT SAYS REALLY IS THAT THAT'S WHY IN FACT WE'RE TAKING THE ENTIRE WHY WE'RE ABLE TO TAKE THE ENTIRE OMEGA AXIS AND JUST MAP IT INTO AN INTER
 OF OF LENGTH PIRIGHT NOW THAT MEANS THAT THERE IS A NON LINEAR DISTORTION OF THE FREQUENCY AXIS IF WE
 TAKE A CONTINUOUS TIME FILTER AND CONVERT IT TO A DISCREET TIME FILTER WITH A BIOLINEAR TRANSFORMATION HOW DO WE ACCOUNT FOR THAT OR FOR THAT MATTER WHEN CAN WE REALLY USE IT AND WE CAN
 SEE HOW TO HOW TO BOTH TAKE ACCOUNT OF IT AND WHAT ITS LIMITATIONS ARE BY RECOGNIZING THE FOLLOWING SUPPOSE THAT I WANTED DO SIGN A DISCREET TIMEI
 ER AND WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IS THAT IT WILL BE MAPPED TO A CONTINUOUS TIME FILTER OR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO FREQUENCY AXES WILL BE GIVEN BY THIS CURVE SO LET'S
 POSE THAT THE CONTINUOUS TIME FREQUENCY RESPONSE LOOKS AS I'VE SHOWN HERE WITH A PASS BAND CUT OFF FREQUENCY AND A STOP BAND CUT OFF FREQUENCY IF THIS WERE MAPPED
 THROUGH THE BILINEAR TRANSFORMATION TO A DISCREET TIME FILTER THEN THIS CUT OFF FREQUENCY WOULD FALL OVER HERE WHICH IS RELATED THROUGH THIS CURVE AND THIS CUT OFF
 FREQUENCY THE STOP BANDAGE WOULD BE HERE AGAIN REFLECTED ITS THESE FREQUENCIES REFLECTED THROUGH THIS CURVE SO LET'S SUPPOSE NOW THAT WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS DESIGN
 IN A DISCREET TIME FILTER WHERE THE DISCREET TIME FILTER HAS CERTAIN FREQUENCY SPECIFICATIONS WHICH IS WHAT OUR PREVIOUS EXAMPLE HAS IT HAS LET'S SAY A SPECIFI
 STOP BANDAGE AND A SPECIFIED A PASS BANDAGE AND A SPECIFIED STOP BANDAGE THE DESIGNED PROCEDURE WOULD THEN CORRESPOND TO MAPPING THOSE FREQUENCIES
 TO THE CORRESPONDING CONTINUOUS TIME FREQUENCIES DESIGNING THE CONTINUOUS TIME FILTER TO MEET THE SPECIFICATIONS BASED ON THOSE CRITICAL FREQUENCIES
 THEN TAKING THE CONTINUOUS TIME DESIGN AND MAPPING IT BACK TO A DISCREET TIME FILTER THROUGH THE BILINEAR TRANSFORMATION RIGHT NOW WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS
 AGAIN MAP A BUTTERWORTH FILTER CONTINUES TIME BUTTERWORTH FILTER TO A DIGITAL FILTER IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE DIGITAL FILTER APPROXIMATELY MEETS THE SPECIFICATIONS THAT WE HAD BEFORE AND LET ME JUST REMIND YOU OF WHERE
 WERE THE CRITICAL FREQUENCIES WERE AT ZERO POINT TWO PI AND ZERO POINT THREE PI AND WHAT WE HAD ASKED FOR IS THAT THE FREQUENCY RESPONSE BE DOWN BY
 NO MORE THAN ONE D B UP TO POINT TWO PI AND DOWN BY AT LEAST FIFTEEN D B AT POINT THREE P SO WE WANT TO TO SIGN THE SAMEDS
 TIME FILTER AS WE DID BEFORE WITH IMPULSE AND VARIANCE WE NOW WANT TO DO IT WITH A BILINEAR TRANSFORMATION APPLIED TO AN APPROPRIATE BUTTERWORTH DESIGN O K WELL SO
 OH LET'S SEE WHAT KIND OF SPECIFICATIONS WE HAVE WE KNOW THAT THE FREQUENCY THE CRITICAL FREQUENCIES ARE MAPPED THROUGH THIS CURVE OR THIS EQUATION AND I INDICATE IT AGAIN THAT
 THIS PEROMETER CAPITAL T IS ARBITRARY IN THE DESIGNED PROCEDURE THAT MAY SEEM CONFUSING INITIALLY BUT THERE'S SOME FURTHER DISCUSSION OF IT IN THE BOOK AND IT'S TRUE AND IMPORTANT TO SORT OUT
 SO WE'RE GOING TO PICK CAPITAL T EQUAL TO UNITY AND THAT MEANS THEN THAT THE CORRESPONDING CRITICAL FREQUENCIES OF THE CONTINUOUS TIME FILTER ARE AT
 TWICE THE TANGENT OF ZERO POINT TWO PI OVER TWO AND TWICE THE TANGENT OF ZERO POINT THREE PI OVER TWO SO THAT MEANS THEN THAT THE SPECIFICATIONS ON OUR CONT
 OS TIME FILTER ARE GIVEN BY THIS ESSENTIALLY PASS BANAN STOP BANDADGE IS WARPED THROUGH THAT NON LINEAR CURVE THIS NON LINEAR CURVE AND I'M USING CAPITAL G HERE TO
 DENOTE THE SYSTEM FUNCTION FOR THE RESULTING CONTINUOUS TIME FILTER AND SO NOW WE COULD THINK OF DESIGNING A BUTTERWORTH FILTER THAT LET'S SAY EXACTLY MEET
 THESE SPECIFICATIONS WELL IF YOU DO THAT WHAT YOU'LL FIND IS THAT YOU GET EXACT EQUALITY HERE IF YOU PICK CAPITAL N
 EQUAL TO FIVE POINT THREE AND AGAIN WE HAVE THE ISSUE THAT IF WE WANT TO MEET OR EXCEED THE SPECIFICATIONS WE CAN'T MAKE THE PILTER ODER LOWER WE HAVE TO MAKE IT HIGHER AND
 WE WOULD MAKE IT INSTEAD OF FIVE POINT THREE WE WOULD MAKE THE FILTER ORDER EQUAL TO SIX AND NOW AGAIN WE HAVE SEVERAL OPTIONS AND TRADE OS BEFORE WITH IMPULSE AND VARIANCE WE ESSENTIALLY
 CIDED TO MEET THE PASS BAND SPECIFICATIONS AND EXCEED THE STOP BAND SPECIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE SOME MARGIN FOR ALIUSING HERE WE DON'T HAVE ANY ALIUSING AND
 WE CAN TRADE THINGS OFF ANY WAY WE LIKE THE WAY THAT I'VE CHOSEN TO DO IT IS TO EXACTLY MEET THE STOP END CUT OFF AND EXCEED THE PASS BAND SPECIFICATIONS
 AND THE RESULT OF DOING THAT IS TO CHOOSE A FILTER ORDER CAPITAL N EQUAL TO SIX AND THE PERAMETER OMEGUS OF C IN THE BUTTERWORTH FILTER IS GIVEN BY ZERO POINT SEVEN
 IX TWO TWO RIGHT SO NOW WE HAVE THE PAROMETERS FOR THE CONTINUOUS TIME BUTTERWORTH PILTER WHICH WHEN
 MAPPED TO THE DISCREET TIME FILTER THROUGH THE BILINEAR TRANSFORMATION WILL EXCEED AUL REQUIREMENTS IN THE PASS BAND AND JUST JUST MEET THE STOP BAND CUT OFF AND SO NOW
 TO COMPLETE THE DESIGNED PROCEDURE AND GIVEN THE PERIMETERS OF THE BUTTERWORTH FILTER WE CAN DRAW OUR APPROPRIATE CIRCLE IN THE SPLANE WHICH HAPPENS TO BE THE
 CIRCLE AS BEFORE BUT WITH A DIFFERENT RADIUS AND THEN ASSOCIATE POLES ON THIS CIRCLE WITH B OF S AND B OF MINUS S IN PARTICULAR TAKE THE ONES IN THE LEFT HALF OF THE S
 PLANE SAME ONES WE HAD BEFORE EXCEPT WE HAVE A DIFFERENT VALUE FOR OMEGAS OF C AND THOSE THEN REPRESENT B OF S SO WE CAN NOW DETERMINE B OF S
 AND ONCE WE HAVE THE TRANSFER FUNCTION B OF S WE THEN MAP THAT TO A DISCREET TIME FILTER BY MAPPING THROUGH THE BILINEAR TRANSFORMATION
 AND THAT THEN IS THE DESIGNED PROCEDURE WHICH WE WOULD FOLLOW FOR THIS EXAMPLE VERY WELL LET'S JUST SEE WHAT THE RESULT LOOKS LIKE WHEN WE'RE DONE HERE I SHOW AGAIN
 AND ON BOTH A LINEAR MAGNITUDE SCALE AND ON A LOGARHYTHMIC OR D B SCALE THE FREQUENCY RESPONSE OF THE RESULTING PILTER AND RECALL THAT THE SPECIFICATIONS WERE THAT AT POINT TWO
 PI WE SHOULD BE DOWN BY NO MORE THAN ONE D B AND CLEARLY WE'VE EXCEEDED THAT CONSIDERABLY AND AT POINT THREE PI WE SHOULD BE A DOWN BY AT LEAST FIFTEEN D B AND WE CHOSE THE DESIGN SO THAT WE WOULD
 ACTLY MEET THAT EDGE SO WE'VE MET THIS POINT AND EXCEEDED THIS POINT AND THIS IS OUR DESIGN NOW LET'S JUST COMPARE THIS WITH THE IMPULSE AND VARIANT DESIGN THAT WE SAW
 A FEW MINUTES AGO THE IMPULSE AND VARIANT DESIGN IS WHAT I INDICATE HERE THE BILINEAR TRANSFORMATION DESIGN IS NOW OVERLAID ON
 OF IT IT'S HARD TO SEE MUCH DIFFERENCE ON A LINEAR MAGNITUDE SCALE BUT LET'S LOOK ON A LOGARHYTHMIC SCALE AND THIS ONE THAT I'M LIFTING IS THE BI LINEAR TRANSFORMATION
 AND THIS IS IMPULSE AND VARIANCE AND NOTICE IN FACT SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING WHICH IS THAT
