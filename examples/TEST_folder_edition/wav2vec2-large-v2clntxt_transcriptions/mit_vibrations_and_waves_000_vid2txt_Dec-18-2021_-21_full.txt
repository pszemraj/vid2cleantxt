 WE WOULD DISCUSS A VERY INTERESTING PHENOMENO TO DAY WHICH IS DISPERSION AND BEFORE DARK WE WOULD DISCUSS A BIT JUST O GIVE YOU SOME REMINDER ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED SO FAR SO WE DISCOVERED THIS EFIQUATION
 WHICH IS SHOWN HERE IN THE CLASS AND WE ALSO SHOW YOU THAT IT DESQRIBED THREE DIFFERENT KINDS OF SISTENCE WHICH WE INCLUDED IN THE LECTURE THE MASSIVE STRINGS WHICH THE STRINGO CANAR
 THE ASSILATE UP AND DOWN IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND ALSO WE DISCUSSED ABOUT SON WAVES E THIS IS ALSO DISCUSSED INAPERIOUS LECTURE AND THE SOND WAVES CAN BE DESCRIBED BY
 WAVY QUESTION AND FINALLY LAS TINE WITH THIS TA ER ELETO MAGNETIC WAVES ISA SPECIAL KIND OF WAVES INVOLVING TWO OSCELLATING FER ONE ESENTIALLY THE ELECTRIC FER THE OTHER
 NIS MAGNETIFIL I SO THAT'S KIND OF INTERESTING BECAUSE THIS IS AT SLIGHTELY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE DISCUSSED BEFORE IN THE PREVIOUS TWO CASES THIS ISSENTUALLY A THREE DIMENSIONAL A WAVE AND ALSO INVOLVING TWO
 DIFFERENT COMPONENTS AND WE ALSO DISCUSS THE THE SOLUTION THE TRAVELLING WAVE SOLUTION OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES AS YOUS YOU CAN SEE FROM HERE HE ELECTRIC FERE IS SHOWN AS THE RAT AND THE MAGNETIC FI
 JOINES TE TROW AND YOU CAN SEE THAT IN CASE OF TRAVELLING WAVE THEY ARE IN FACE AND THAT THE MAGNETUDE REACH MAXIMA SIMULTANEOUSLY FOR THE ELECTRIC ELECTRIC FIR AND THE MAGNETIC FIR AND WHILE IN THE CASE OF STANDING WAVE
 THERE'S A FACE DIFFERENCE RIGHT SO THEY DON'T REACH MAXIMA SIMULTANEOUSLY IN UNDERSTANDING ELECTROMAGNETI CASE OK SO WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DISCUSS TO DAY WE WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS
 HESTRATOGY TO SEND INFORMATION ARE USING WAVES OK HOW DO WE AS YO SEND INFORMATION ARE USING WAVES SO YOU CAN SAY O K YOU JUST DO MAYBE I CAN JUST SEND THE HARMONIC
 OSCILLATION RISE OCCUPI TO THIS HARMONIC OSCELLATION I CAN VATL PRODUCE HARMONICAL WAVES I THEY MOVING UP AND DOWN AND TE ESPETILTE WITH A CONSTANT
 GAA MOMENTON AND ANGAA A FREQUENCY AND THE MAYBE THAT'S A WAY TO SEND THE INFORMATION BUT BUT THIS KIND OF A WAVE IS NOT IN IALITY NOT SUPERHEALFUL BECAUSE IF YOU
 THE WHOLE SPACE WITH HARMONIC WAVES THEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN DID YOU ACTUALLY SEND THE SIGNAL IGHT BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS ASOLATING UP AND DOWN SO YOU DON'T KNOW THE STARTING KIND OF THE SIGNAL I SO SO IN REALITY THIS
 OF SIMPLE HARMONIC OSCILATING TROUBLING WAVE IS NOT SUPER HELPFUL SO WHAT IS IT TO HEALPFUL THAT'S THE QUESTION SO WHAT IS ACTUALLY HELPFUL IS TO PRODUCE SQUARE POUS FOR EXAMPLE LAT WE
 CREATE SQUARE POWS FOR EXAMPLE IN THIS IN THIS CASE I CAN CREATE A SQUARE POUS HERE AND IN THE NEXT TIME INTERVAL I DON'T CREATE SQUARE POWS IN THE NEXT TIME INTERVAL I DON'T DO ANYTHING AND I CREATE ANOTHER SQUARE POWS
 ET CETERA ETCETERA IF YOU USE THIS KIND OF STRATOGY WHAT WE CAN DO IS TO HAVE SOME KIND OF RECEIVER HERE TO ASSUTY MEASURE THE MAGNITUDE OF THE
 MAGNITUDE OF THE POWERS O AND THEN WE CAN NATRL INTERPRETE THIS DATA SO SO THIS OR THIS THIS WAYVE IS GOING TO WERE THE POSITIVE X DIRECTION OR GOING TO THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE BOARD AND THE RECEIVER WILL BE ABLE TO INTERPRET
 WI HIS DATA BY PRASING IS RACIO UNDER ENERGY OR UNDER MATRDE MPUTO THEN I CAN CAN SAY OH NOW I'D RECEIVE A ZERO AND TH THE NEXT A SIGNAL AND RECEIVING IS ONE AND THIS ONE IS ZERO
 ZERO AND ONE AND ZERO IN THIS WAY I CAN ESE THE SCENT INFORMATION AND H THIS INFORMATION CAN BE BARITING AS A FUNCTIONAL TAO SO IN SHORT WHAT WIULL BE USEFUL IS PROBABLY TO USE A NARROW
 SQUARE PIS AND NOW WE BE VERY HELPFUL IN TRANSMITTING O INFORMATION OK SO AH IF WE CONSIDER A IDEAL STRING CASE OK IF I HAVE
 DEAL STRING AS WE LEARNED BEFORE AA THE BEHAVIOR OF THIS STRING IS DESCRIBED BY A A THE WAVE EQUATION I PASSE SQUARE
 PATO T SQUARE AND THIS IS EQUAL TO B SQUARE PAT SQUARE SI PAT T SQUARE OK AND THE DIS V IS ACTUALLY RELATED TO THE THAT THE SPEED OF THE PROGRESSING WAY
 AS WE DISCUSS BEFORE THE PROGRESSING WAVE SOLUTION O AND THATII IF I HAVE THIS IDEALIZED STRING AND OBEY THE WAVE EQUATION THE SIMPLE VERSION OF WAVE EQUATION THEN I WILL BE ABLE
 TO DERIVE THE DISPERSION RELATION RIGHT SO I CAN NOW WRITE DOWN MY HARMONIC ASPOASING WAVE IN THE FORM OF SIGN K X MINUS OMEGA T IF I HAVE A HARMONIC ISCELLATING WAVE
 ATING TOWARD THE POSITIVE EX DIRECTION AT SPEED OF V I CAN WRITE IT DOWN IN THIS FUNCTIONAL FORM WHERE K AS A REMINDER IS THE WAVE NUMBER AND THE OMEGA IS A DESCRIBED
 HOWISOE TEA ANGER FREQUENCY AND THEREFORE IF I PRAKING THIS SOLUTION AND OF COURSE I CAN HAVE ARBITRARY AMPITU IF I PRAKING THIS SOLUTION TO THIS QUESTION THEN WHAT I
 CON TO GETTIS AS WE ADID IN THE LAST FEW LECTURES THERE WILL BE A FIXED RELATION BETWEEN K WHICH IS TEWAY A NUMBER AND OMEGA THE ANGA FREQUENCY SO THE FIXED RELATION IS SAY TO THE OMEGA
 OBER K WILL BE EQUAL TO V WHICH WIS ATUAI THE VELOCITY IN THIS WAV EQUATION AND THAT FROM THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSION WE KNOW THIS SET EQUAL TO A SQUARE DOT OF T OFE ROW
 L WHERE T IS SATA ATTENTION THE CONSTANT TENTION WHICH WE APPRY ON THE STRING AND THE ROLL L ESSENTIALLY THE MASPER ONI LENDS US A REMINDER OK SO WHAT DOES THIS
 WHAT DOES THIS EQUATION MEAN WE CALL IT TIS PERSION RELATION A A TINE RIGHT BUT WE ACTUALLY DIDN'T EXPLAIN WHY DO I DO THAT RIGHT SO WE ARE GOING TO LEARN WHY THIS IS A YOU CALL THIS PERSION RELATION OR MAKE OUT AS
 NO K AND IN THIS CASE IN THIS VERY SIMPLE FIGHT IDEALIZE THE CASE OMEGA OVER K THIS RATIO O K WE KNOW THIS IS RELATED TO THE PROPAGATION OFTHE
 SPEEDABLHE PROPAGATION OF THE HARMONICAL WAVE OK IS EQUAL TO V B IS A CONSTANT IS INDEPENDENT OF K THIS RATIO IS INDEPENDENT OF K WHAT DOES THAT MEAN THAT MEANS
 IF I PREPARE WAVES OK WITH DIFFERENT WAVE NUMBER OR IN THE OTHER WORDS WAVES WITH DIFFERENT WAVE LANDS THEY ARE GOING TO PROPARGATE AT THE
 SPEED RIGHT SO THE SPEED OF THE HARMONIC PROGRESSING WAVE IS ITS INDEPENDENT OF THE WAVELETSOK THAT SAYS YO VERY
 BECAUSE IN THIS CASE IF I PREPARE THE SQUARE HOUSE AS WE LEARNED BEFORE THI SQUARE POUSE ESSENTIAL TE ER A VERY COMPLICATED OBJECT E SQUARE POUSE IS REALLY VERY COMPLICATED YOU CAN DO
 PUDIA DECOMPOSITION AS WE DID BEFORE AND WE KNIT INFINITE NUMBER OF TURNS OF HARMONIC OSCILLATING WAVES WITH WHICH WE ADD THEM TOGETHER SO THAT I CAN PRODUCE A SQUARE
 OK AND AS I MENTION HERE IF THE DISPERSION RELATION IS OMECA OBA K IS A CONSEN ESA CONSTANTLY THAT MEANS ALL THE WHATEVER
 OF WAVE LANDS POWS WHICH I SHOULD BE ADDED TOGETHER AND PRODUCE THES SQUARE POWS ARE GOING TO BE TROUBLEDING AT THE SAME SPEED THEREFORE A IF I HAVE THIS SQUARE
 OSE IN THE BEGINNING AFTER SOME TIME TE WHAT I AM GOING TO GET IS THAT OGE THIS IS THE ORIGINAL POSITION OF THE SQUARE POWS AND AFTER SOME TIME T THIS SQUARE POW
 WERE MOVED BY THE TINT IN THE HORENTAL DIRECTION AND THE SHAPE OF THE POWS IS NOT GOING TO BE CHANGED CA PICS NO MATTER WHAT KIND OF WAVE LANDS WHICH PRODUCE THE SQUARE POWS
 ALL THE COMPONENTS IN THE SQUARE POS ARE PROPAGATING AT THE SAME A SPEED BE SO THIS KIND OF SYSTEM THIS KIND OF A SYSTEM WHICH AS YOU SAI SATISFIED A THIS
 OF A LIS A DISPERSION RELATION IS CALLED NON DISPERSIVE MEDIAM RIGHT NO DISPERSION WAS HAPPENING IN THIS IN THIS CASE IN THIS HIGHLY IDEALIZED CASE OK
 WE ALSO KNOW THAT IN CASE OF THE STRING WE ARE ACTUALLY MAKING IT TOO IDEALIZED RIGHT SO IF WE CONSIDER A MORE REALISTIC STRING THEN
 I HAVE TO CONSIDER AN IMPORTANTAA PHENOMENA WHICH ISTH OR SAY IMPORTANT PROPERTY OF THE STRING FOR EXAMPLE STEEPNESS I WHAT DO I MEAN BY STEEPNESS FOREMP
 IF I CAN IF I TAKE A STRING FROM THE PIANO A PIANO STRING OK EVEN IF I DON'T APPLY ANY ATTENTION TO THE STRING IF I BEND THIS STRING OU DON'T LIKE IT
 IT'S GOING TO BOUNCE BACK AND RESTORE TO ITS ORIGINAL SHAPE RIGHT SO THATS I WHAT I CALL STEEPNESS IT'S A DIFFERENT CONTRIBUTION COMPARED TO THE STRIN TENSION RIT SO WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DISCS
 SING SO FAR THAT THIS RESTORTING FORCE ESSENTIALLY COMING FROM THE STRING TENSION TA OK WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF I INTRODUCE ADDITIONAL A CONTRIBUTION FROMTHE
 STEEPNESS OK THIS STEEPNESS ESSENTIALLY NOT COMPLETELY RELATED TO THE STRING TENSION AND HE ALSO WANTS TO RESTORE THE SHAPE OF THE STRING OK BEFORE WE GO TO THE MATODING
 I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE SOME VOTE TO PREDICT WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN HOW MANY OF YOU WILL PREDICT THAT IF I INTRODUCE INCRUDE THE STIEFNESS OF THE STRING OR GET INTO MY EQUATION WHEREE
 SPEED OF PROPAGATION INCREASE HOW MANY OF YOU THINK WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SO SO SOME OF YOU
 PREDICT THE SPEED OF PROPAGATION WERE INCREASED HOW MANY OF YOU PREDICT THAT THE SPEED OF PROPAGATION OF THE HARMONIC WAVE WILL STAY THE SAND HOW MANY OF YOU ONE
 OK ONLY ONE OK HOW MANY OF YOU A SOULD PREDICT THAT THE SPEED OF PROPAGATION WOULD DECREASE
 OK TO ALL THE OTHER STUDENTS DON'T HAVE OPINION OK WANT TO WAIT FOR THE ANSWER
 ALL RIGHT SO YOU CAN SEE THAT IT IS SAS YOUIDNOT COMPRETY OBIOUS BEFORE WE SOLVE THIS QUESTION ANDE WE ARE GOING TO SOLVE IT WITH A SIMPLE MOTTO WHICH WE SHOULD SLIGHTLY MODIFY
 THE A THE IDEALIZE CASE WE IDEALIZE THE WAVY QUESTION OK SO NOW ONE SEMI REALISTIC MOTO WHICH I CAN INTRODUCE IS TO ADD A TURN ADDITION
 TURN TO THE WAFY QUESTION SO I CAN NOW RE WRITE MY WAYQUESTION TO INCRUDE ISIFI DISEFECT TO DESCRIBE A REALISTIC STRING AND NOW DISET PATO SQUARSA PATOTIS
 SQUARE THIS WILL BE EQUAL TO B SQUARE PART SQUARE SI PATTSQUARE AND THE ADDITIONAL TERM WHICH I HAVE PUT INTO THIS GAN IS MINUS AFA PARTTEFOR
 SI PARTIA X TO FOR AND THIS ESSENTIALLY THE CONTRIBUTION WHICH FROM THE STIPNESSTIFNESS OK
 SO YOU CAN SEE THAT THE THE WAFY QUESTION IS NOW MODIFIED AND WHAT I COULD DO IN ORDER TO GET THE RELATION BETWEEN OMEGA AND THE K WHAT I COULD DO IS THAT I CAN NOW START
 WITH THIS A HARMONIC WAVE SOLUTION A PUBLIC OQUASING WAVE SOLUTION PRACK THAT INTO THIS EQUATION THIS MODIFI THE EQUATION AND SEE WHAT WILL HAPPEN OK IF I PRACTHISE EQUATION
 INTO THAT MODIFIED WAVY QUESTION WHAT I AM GOING TO GET IS THE BOWING SOPACITY THE LAUGHAND SIGH YOU ARE GOING TO GET OR MAKE A SQUARE O K MINUS MAKE A SQUARE AND THE THE RIGHT HAND SIHE
 GET B SQUARE MINUSA K SQUARE ANPRAS AFAA K TO THE FOUR IN THE RIGHT HAND SI OK SO OF COURSE I CAN
 CANSEL THIS A MINUS SIGN THIS WILL BECOME PRAS AND THIS WILL BECOME MINUS AND WE CAN SEE THAT THE RELATION BETWEEN OMEGA AND THE K IS NOW DIFFERENT OK AFTER I INTRODUCE
 THIS TERM WHICH IS PROPORTIONAL TO A AFI CETURY DESCRIBING HOW STIFF THISA STRAIN IS OK OF COURSE NOW I CAN CALCULATE OR MAKE AT OFA K
 SA TOLE AS WE ACTUALLY LEARNED BEFORE RIGHT IS THE SPEED OF THE PROPAGATION OF A HARMONIC AE A HARMONIC WAVE OK SUPASILY IF I CALCULATE OR MAKE A BOQE FOND IS
 THEN PASITE WHILE YOU GET IS V SQUARE DUD OF ONE PUS AFA SQUARE O K SO IF YOU LOOK AT THIS EQUATION OK THE FIRST REACTION IS
 NOW THIS OMEGA AND KRACO IS NOT A CONSTANT ANY MORE AS A FUNCTION O K WHAT DOES THAT MEAN THAT MEANS IF I
 AR PROGRESSING WAVES WITH DIFFERENT WAVE LENTS OR WAVE NUMBER KOK IT'S GOING TO BE PROPAGATING AT DIFFERENT SPEED OK BEFORE WE INTRODUCE
 ING INTO THE ARMAND INTO THE MOTO THE RATIO OMACA AN K IS A CONSTANT V INDEPENDENT OF K NOW ONCE YOU INTRODUCE THIS MODO INTO THE EQUATION
 AND YOU PRAGIN THUS A PROGRESSING WAVE SOLUTION TOO ASECHECK THE DISPERSION RELATION OBTAINEDID FROM THIS EQUATION YOU FIND THAT THE PROGRESSING WAVE AE SPEEDO
 GRESSING WAVE DEPENDS ON HOW DISTORTED THIS PROGRESSING WAVE IS OK SO LET ME COMPARE THIS TWO SITUATION
 IN DIS GRAF OMEGA VERSUSK OK SO YOU SEE THIS DISPERSION RELATION GRAV PRETTY OFTEN IN THE IN THE CUST TO DAY THE Y XIS I SETLY THE OMEGAA ANGULAR
 QUENCY AND THE K IS THE WEIGHT NUMBER TWO PI OBE LONDON IN THE ORIGINAL CASE IN THE CASE I HAVE THIS IDEALIZED STRING OBEYED
 THE WAVQUATION WHICH I W INTRODUCE IN THE PREVIOUS LECTURES IF I PROT OR MAKE OUT AS A FUNCTIONA K WHAT I AM GETTING IS A STRAIGHT LINE O K QUESTION
 A NOT THIS INE RIHT OH MAYBE I HA MADE SOME MISTAKE HERE
 YOU SHOULD BE AR YOU SHOULD BE ALSO PROS HERE RIGHTTO NO SO YOU HAVE THIS OMEO SO THISIS O MAKASQUAR
 ANDE AS US HAVE THIS MINUS INT HERE I SOGHT SO THIS SHOULD BE MINUS AND THIS SHOULD BE O K LET'S GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL EQUATION OK SO BASILY YOU
 SO IF I PROCKING THIS EQUESTION TO THIS EQUETION RIGHT SO BESILY I GET MINUS O MAKA SQUARE OUT OF IT AND I GET MINUS K SQUARE OUT OF THIS AND I'M GOING TO GET A PROSQE TO THE
 OR OUT OF THIS PART SQUARE TO THE FOUR SIE PARTO X FOUR EH OK THEREFORE THIS SHOULD BE MINUS O MAYBE I MADE A MISTE THINK THANK YOU MUCH FOR FOR SPORTING THAT
 A INTROCEO SI
