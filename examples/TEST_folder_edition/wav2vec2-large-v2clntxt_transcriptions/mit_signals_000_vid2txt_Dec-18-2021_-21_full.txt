 LAST TIME WE INTRODUCED THE NOTION OF MAPPING CONTINUOUS TIME
 TERS TO DISCREET TIME FILTERS AND WE DEVELOPED IMPULSE AND VARIANCE AS ONE USEFUL TECHNIQUE FOR CARRYING OUT THAT TYPE OF MAPPING WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IN THIS LECTURE IS ILLUSTRATE
 IMPULSE AND VARIANCE AS A DESIGNED PROCEDURE IN THE CONTEXT OF ONE SPECIFIC CLASS OF FILTERS NAMELY BUTTERWORTH FILTERS AND THEN FOLLOWING THAT WELL PROCEED ON TO DISCUSS ANOTHER
 IMPORTANT AND USEFUL MAPPING OR DESIGN PROCEDURE REFERRED TO AS THE BILINEAR TRANSFORMATION SO TO BEGIN LET ME JUST DISCUSS BRIEFLY WHAT THE CLASS OF BUTTERWORTH FILTERS IS AND
 D SPECIFICALLY THE BUTTERWORTH FILTERS ARE DEFINED THROUGH THEIR FREQUENCY RESPONSE OR TRANSFER FUNCTION AND IAM USING CAPITAL B TO DENOTE A BUTTERWORTH FILTER AND BY DEFINITION THE
 MAGNITUDE SQUARED OF THE FREQUENCY RESPONSE OF A BUTTERWORTH PILTER IS GIVEN BY THIS EXPRESSION AND FOR EXAMPLE IF N WERE EQUAL TO ONE THEN THIS WOULD SIMPLY CORRESPOND TO THE MAGNITUDE SQUARED OF THE FREQUENCY RESPONSE
 AFIRST ORDER DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION NOW IF YOU LOOK AT THE FREQUENCY RESPONSE B OF OMEGA FOR THIS CLASS OF FILTERS I'VE ILLUSTRATED THAT BELOW AND
 WHAT WE SEE IS THAT THE FREQUENCY RESPONSE STARTS AT UNITY BECAUSE THA THAT'S THE WAY THAT IT'S NORMALIZED AND IT HAS A MONOTONIC CHARACTERISTIC IN THE PASS BAND AND IN THE STOP BAND
 A FREQUENCY EQUAL TO THE PARIMETER OMEGUS OF C UP HERE WHICH IS REFERRED TO AS THE CUT OFF FREQUENCY THE BUTTERWORTH FILTER FREQUENCY RESPONSE ALWAYS GOES THROUGH THE SAME POINT NAMELY POINT SEVEN O SEVEN
 AND AS THE ORDER OF THE BUTTERWORTH FILTER CAPITAL N INCREASES THE TRANSITION FROM THE PASS BAND TO THE STOP BAND BECOMES SHARPER AND SHARPER SO FOR HIGHER ORDER FILTERS
 AN THE FREQUENCY RESPONSES FLATTER IN THE PASS BAND AND DROPS OFF MORE QUICKLY AND ATTENUATES MORE IN THE STOP BAN NOW IN DESIGNING BUTTERWORTH FILTERS WHAT WE WILL WANT TO LOOK AT
 IS THE LOCATION OF THE POLES OF THE SYSTEM FUNCTION AND WE CAN INFER THOSE FROM OUR DEFINITION OF WHAT THE FREQUENCY RESPONSE FOR THE BUTTERWORTH FILTER IS IN PARTICULAR
 WE HAVE THIS EXPRESSION FOR THE MAGNITUDE SQUARED OF THE FREQUENCY RESPONSE AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT OF COURSE AS B OF JOMEGA TIMES B OF MINUSJ
 OMEGA THAT'S WHAT THE MAGNITUDE SQUARED WILL BE EQUAL TO AND IN ORDER TO CONVERT THIS TO AN EXPRESSION DESCRIBING THE SYSTEM FUNCTION OR IN TERMS OF THE MORE GENERAL APPLAUSE TRANSFORM VARIABLE S
 WHAT WE RECOGNIZE IS THAT GOMEGA IN THE MORE GENERAL SETTING SIMPLY CORRESPONDS TO THE LAPLACE TRANSFORMED VARIABLE S SO THIS PRODUCT IN FACT
 IS THE LAPLACE TRANSFORM FOR S EQUAL TO J OMEGA MORE GENERALLY THAN THIS IS THE RESULT OF EVALUATING B OF S TIMES B OF MINUS S AT S EQUALS J OMEGA CONSEQUENTLY COMPARING
 THIS EXPRESSION WITH THIS STATEMENT LEADS US TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE TRANSFER FUNCTION B OF S OF THE BUTTERWORTH PILTER TIMES B OF MINUS S IS GIVEN BY THE EXPRESSION THAT I
 AT HERE SIMPLY REPLACING J OMEGA BY S NOW WHAT WE WANT TO LOOK AT ARE THE POLES OF B OF S THAT'S WHAT WE'LL WANT TO GET AS WE DESIGN A BUTTERWORTH
 TER AND WE CAN RECOGNIZE THE POLES OF THIS PRODUCT SIMPLY BY LOOKING AT THE ROOTS OF THE DENOMINATOR POLENOMIAL AND THOSE ROOTS ARE JUST TAKING ACCOUNT OF THIS FACTOR TWO N THOSE ROOTS
 ARE AT J OMEGA SUB C TIMES THE TWO N ROOTS OF MINUS ONE THOSE ROOTS IN FACT ALL LIE ON A CIRCLE AND THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT
 IS THAT THE POLES OF THIS EXPRESSION ARE ON A CIRCLE THE CIRCLE IS OF RADIUS OMEGUS OF C AND THE POLES ARE
 IBUTED AROUND THE CIRCLE SO HERE I HAVE ILLUSTRATED THE POLES OF B OF S TIMES B OF MINUS S FOR THE SPECIFIC CASE WHERE CAPITAL N IS EQUAL TO THREE SO THERE ARE A TOTAL OF SIX POLES AROUND THIS CIRCLE
 AND THEN FOR THIS SPECIFIC CASE THE POLES ARE SPACED BY SIXTY DEGREES NOW WE HAVE B OF S TIMES B OF MINUS S TO GET THE SYSTEM FUNCTION FOR THE BUTTERWORTH FILTER WE'D LIKE TO GET
 B OF S AND THE QUESTION NOW IS HOW DO WE GET THAT WELL THE THING TO RECOGNIZE IS THAT WHEREVER THIS FACTOR HAS A ROOT THIS FACTOR HAS TO HAVE A ROOT
 AT THE NEGATIVE LOCATION SO IN FACT WHEN WE LOOK AT THESE POLES WE COMPARE THEM WITH THIS FOR EXAMPLE ASSOCIATED WITH B OF S THIS ASSOCIATED WITH B OF MINUS S AND LIKEWISE WE COMPARE THESE TWO TO
 THER LIKEWISE WE COM PARE THESE TWO TOGETHER AND SO WE CAN EXTRACT B OF S FROM THIS PRODUCT SIMPLY BY TAKING ONE POLE OUT OF EACH OF THOSE PEAIRS NOW A QUESTION OF COURSE IS OUT OF EACH PAIR WHICH ON
 DO WE ASSOCIATE WITH B OF S AND WHICH DO WE ASSOCIATE WITH B OF MINUS S AND THE ANSWER DROPS OUT FAIRLY SIMPLY IF WE RECOGNIZE THAT IF WE WANT TO DESIGN FILTERS THAT ARE STABLE
 THEN B OF S THE TRANSFER FUNCTION THAT WE'RE DESIGNING MUST HAVE ALL ITS POLES IN THE LEFT HALF OF THE SPLANE SO IN FACT WE WOULD ASSOCIATE OUT OF EACH OF THESE PAIRS WE WOULD ASSOCIATE THE LEFT HALF PLANE POLE WITH B OF S
 AND SO THE TRANSFER FUNCTION FOR THE BUTTERWORTH FILTER FOR THIS PARTICULAR CASE WHERE THE PEROMETER WHERE THIS DESIGNATES THE PEROMETER OMEGUS OF C AND CAPITAL N IS THREE NAMELY A THIRD ORDER
 BUTTERWORTH PILTER IS THIS SET OF POLE LOCATIONS GIVEN THOSE OF COURSE WE CAN FIGURE OUT SIMPLY THROUGH ALGEBRAIC MEANS WHAT THE TRANSFER FUNCTION B OF S ALL RIGHT SO THAT'S WHAT
 BUTTERWORTH FILTERS ARE AND NOW WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS TALK ABOUT THE DESIGN OF A DIGITAL BUTTERWORTH FILTER USING THE DESIGN TECHNIQUE THAT WE INTRODUCED LAST TIME NAMELY
 AND VARIANCE AND THE CONTEXT IN WHICH I WILL PHRASE THE DESIGN IS THE CONTEXT OF MAPPING A CONTINUOUS TIME SIGNAL TO A DISCREET TIME SIGNAL
 ING OUT FILTERING USING THE DISCREET TIME FILTER THAT WE'RE DESIGNING AND THEN MAPPING BACK SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW A DISCREET TIME FILTER THAT WE WANT TO DESIGN THROUGH IMPULSE ANDINVARIANCE
 OM BUTTERWORTH FILTERS FROM CONTINUOUS TIME BUTTERWORTH FILTERS AND WE'RE GOING TO GET OUR DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF HAVING CONSIDERED DISCREET TIME PROCESSING OF CONTINUOUS TIME SIGNALS
 WHERE WE WILL MAP FROM A CONTINUOUS TIME SIGNAL TO A SEQUENCE CARRY OUT THE FILTERING WITH THE DISCREET TIME FILTER THAT WE'RE GOING TO DESIGN AND THEN
 WE WILL TAKE THE RESULTING FILTERED OUTPUT AND MAP IT BACK TO THE CONTINUOUS TIME SIGNAL BUT THIS DISCREET TIME FILTER IS THE ONE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DES
 INING AND FOR A CHOICE OF PAROMETER THERE'S A SAMPLING FREQUENCY OF COURSE INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS AND THE VALUE THAT I'LL PICK FOR THE SAMPLING FREQUENCY IS TEN KILLAHERTS O K ALL FAIRLY
 STRAIGHTFORWARD SO FAR AND SO SINCE WE HAVE A SAMPLING RATE OF TEN KILLEHERTS WE WANT TO FIRST LOOK AT OUR SPECIFICATIONS ON
 THE DESIRED CONTINUOUS TIME FILTER AND THEN MAP THOSE TWO APPROPRIATE SPECIFICATIONS ON THE DISCREET TIME FILTER AND WHAT I'LL PICK FOR THE DESIRED SPECIFICATIONS ON THE
 NOUS TIME FILTER IS THAT AT ONE KILLE HURTS I WILL ASK THAT THE CONTINUOUS TIME FREQUENCY RESPONSE BE DOWN BY NO MORE
 THAN ONE D B IN COMPARISON WITH ITS VALUE AT OMEGA EQUALS ZERO SO THAT IN EFFECT SPECIFIES THE BEHAVIOR IN THE PASS BAND OR THE SPECIFICATIONS ON THE PASS BAND
 AND FOR THE STOP BAND I'LL SPECIFY THAT THE FILTER IS DOWN BY FIFTEEN D B BY THE TIME WE'VE GOTTEN TO ONE AND A HALF KILLER HURTS SO WE HAVE ESSENTIALLY
 THE BEGINNING OF THE TRANSITION BAND THE END OF THE PASS BAND AT ONE KILLA HERTS AND THE BEGINNING OF THE STOP BAND AT ONE POINT FIVE KILLE HERTS AND SINCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DESIGNING A BUTTERWORTH FILTER WE KNOW THAT THE BUTTERWORTH
 FILTER IS MONOTONIC IN THE PASS BAND AND STOP BAND AND SO WE'LL HAVE A FILTER SPECIFICATION SOMETHING AS I SHOW HERE THIS REPRESENTS THE ALLOWABLE PASS BAND TOLERANCE
 IS IS THE ALLOWABLE STOP ANT TOLERANCE AND IF I CAN DRAW THIS WITHOUT GETTING MYSELF INTO TROUBLE ESSENTIALLY WE'RE LOOKING FOR A FILTER THEN THAT ALWAYS STAYS BETWEEN
 THE SPECIFIED BOUNDARIES HERE NOW WHAT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT IS WHAT THE CORRESPONDING SPECIFICATIONS ARE FOR THE DIGITAL FILTER AND THE STRATEGY LET ME
 EMPHASIZE IS THAT WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE WE'RE DOING CONTINUOUS TIME A DISCREET TIME PROCESSING OF CONTINUOUS TIME SIGNALS AND WE HAVE A SET OF
 S ASSOCIATED WITH THAT THAT IMPOSES SPECIFICATIONS ON OUR DISCREET TIME FILTER AND THEN WE WANT TO DESIGN THE DISCREET TIME FILTER USING IMPULSE AND VARIANCE AND THAT'S THE DISCREET TIME FILTER THAT WE'LL USE IN THE OVER
 SYSTEM ALL RIGHT NOW WE WANT SPECIFICATIONS ON THE DISCREET TIME FILTER AND WE WANT THE CONTINUOUS OVERALL EQUIVALENT SYSTEM TO
 AVE CERTAIN A MEET CERTAIN SPECIFICATIONS AT CERTAIN FREQUENCIES RELATED TO CONTINUOUS TIME FREQUENCIES RECALL THAT WHEN WE SAMPLE A CONTINUOUS TIME SIGNAL THERE IS
 SPECIFIC MAPPING FROM THE CONTINUOUS TIME FREQUENCY AXIS TO THE DISCREET TIME FREQUENCY AXIS IN PARTICULAR THE SAMPLING FREQUENCY GETS MAPPED TO TO PI WELL THAT
 ANS THAT OUR OTHER CRITICAL FREQUENCIES GET MAPPED IN PROPORTION TO THAT SO ONE KILLER HURTS WHICH IS A TENTH OF THE SAMPLING FREQUENCY WOULD THEN CONVERT TO A DISCREET TIME FREQUENCY OF POINT TWO
 AND ONE AND A HALF KILLE HERTS WILL CONVERT TO A DISCREET TIME FREQUENCY OF POINT THREE PI SO WHAT THIS SAYS IS THAT FOR THE DISCREET TIME FILTER
 WE WOULD LIKE THE SAME BEHAVIOR BUT AT FREQUENCIES OR THE SAME SPECIFICATIONS BUT AT FREQUENCIES NORMALIZED TO THE DISCREET TIME FREQUENCY AXIS THAT MEANS
 THAT WE WANT THE DISCREET TIME FREQUENCY FREQUENCY RESPONSE MAGNITUDE TO BE GREATER THAN ARE EQUAL TO MINUS ONE D B AT TWO TENTHS PI CORRESPONDING TO THE ONE KILLER HURTS IN CONTINUOUS TIME
 AND FOR THE BEGINNING OF THE STOP END THAT WOULD OCCUR AT POINT THREE PI AT WHICH POINT WE WANT THIS LESS THAN AR EQUAL TO MINUS FIFTEEN SO THOSE ARE OUR DISCREET TIME SPECIFICATIONS
 AND WE NOW WANT TO DESIGN THE DISCRETIM PILTER USING IMPULSE AND VARIANCE NOW IN IMPULSE AND VARIANCE AS YOU RECALL IT CORRESPONDS TO
 SAMPLING GENERATING AN IMPULSE RESPONSE WHICH IS A SAMPLED VERSION OF THE CONTINUOUS TIME IMPULSE RESPONSE AND THERE IS A TEMPTATION NATURALLY TO THINK OF THIS
 PERAMETER CAPITAL T AS NECESSARILY IDENTICAL TO THE SAMPLING IN THE SYSTEM IN WHICH THE FILTER IS GOING TO BE USED NOW THIS IS A FAIRLY SUBTLE COMPE
 TED TONGUE TWISTING ISSUE BUT THE BOTTOM LINE ON IT THE ESSENTIAL POINT IS THAT THE PERIMETER CAPITAL T THAT WE USE IN IMPULSE AND VARIANT DESIGN IS A TOTALLY DIFFERENTUN
 TED AND IN FACT AS IT TURNS OUT ARBITRARY PERIMETER WHICH IS NOT NECESSARILY PEGGED TO THE SAMPLING FREQUENCY AND I THINK IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR ME TO TOTALLY CLARIFY THAT
 DURING THE LECTURE IT'S DISCUSSED MORE IN THE BOOK AND CERTAINLY YOU SHOULD TAKE PLENTY OF TIME TO REFLECT ON IT AL RIGHT BUT LET'S NOW LOOK THEN AT WHERE WE ARE IN OUR DESIGN
 CEDURE AND SPECIFICALLY WHAT IT IS THAT WE NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO DESIGN THE DIGITAL BUTTERWORTH FILTER NOW WE HAVE A SET OF SPECIFICATIONS THAT
 W WE'VE GENERATED RELATING ESSENTIALLY TO HOW WE WANT THE PASS BAND OF THE DIGITAL FILTER AND THE STOP AND OF THE DIGITAL FILTER TO BEHAVE OF COURSE SINCE THIS ISN'T AN IDEAL FILTER IT
 AS SOME TRANSITION FROM PASS BAND TO STOP END AND AS WE DISCUSSED LAST TIME THERE IS A ALIASING WHICH WE NEEDT AT LEAST BE AWARE OF WE'VE SPECIFIED CERTAIN FREQUENCIES
 THIS AXIS WHICH ARE EASILY CONVERTED BY RELATING THE TWO AXES THROUGH THIS MAPPING ARE EASILY RELATED BACK TO THE CONTINUOUS
 FREQUENCY AXIS AS WE HAVE HERE AND IN PARTICULAR NOW IF WE WERE TO SIMPLY PICK THAT PEROMETER IN THE IMPULSE AND VARIANT DESIGN CAPITAL T AS
 EQUAL TO UNITY AND I INDICATED JUST A MINUTE AGO THAT WE CAN PICK IT ARBITRARILY IF I PICK IT AS UNITY THEN THE PROCEDURE WOULD CONSIST OF DESIGNING THE CONTINUOUS TIME BUTTERWORTH
 LTER WITH MEETING THE OR EXCEEDING THE APPROPRIATE SPECIFICATIONS AND THEN GOING THROUGH THE IMPULSE AND VARIANT PROCEDURE ALL RIGHT SO LET'S DO THAT THEN
 WE WANT THE DISCREET TIME IMPULSE RESPONSE TO BE THE CONTINUOUS TIME IMPULSE RESPONSE SAMPLED AND FOR CONVENIENCE I'M GOING TO PICK THIS PERAMETER CAPITAL T EQUAL TO ONE THAT
 S THAT THE FREQUENCY NORMALIZATION BETWEEN THE DISCRETE TIME FREQUENCY AXIS AND THE CONTINUOUS TIME FREQUENCY AXIS IN FACT IS THAT THOSE AXES ARE SCALED IDENTICALLY BECAUSE
 CAPITAL T IS EQUAL TO ONE AND SO NOW WE WANT THE ANALOGUE OR CONTINUOUS TIME SPECIFICATIONS AND SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO THEN IS DESIGN A BUTTERWORTH PILTER AMUSING CAPI
 BE HERE AGAIN TO DENOTE THE FREQUENCY RESPONSE OF THE BUTTERWORTH FILTER THE BUTTERWORTH FILTER TO HAVE A MAGNITUDE WHICH IS GREATER THAN AR EQUAL TO MINUS ONE D B PRIOR TO THE FREQUENCY ZERO POINT TWO PI AND LESS
 ARE EQUAL TO MINUS FIFTEEN AT A FREQUENCY BEYOND ZERO POINT THREE PI AND SO NOW WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS DETERMINE CAPITAL N AND
 AGA OF C IN ORDER TO MEET OR EXCEED THOSE SPECIFICATIONS NOW IF YOU GO THROUGH THE ASSOCIATED ALGEBRA IN DOING THAT LET'S SAY THAT YOU DECIDE THAT YOU WANT TO PICK CAPITALAN AND OMEGAS OF C TO EXACT
 MEET THOSE INEQUALITIES AT THE TWO FREQUENCIES POINT TWO PINE POINT THREE PI WHAT YOU'LL FIND AFTER GOING THROUGH THE ALGEBRA IS THAT THEY'RE EXACTLY MET IF CAPITAL N IS
 EPOINT EIGHT EIGHT AND OMEGAS OF C IS POINT SEVEN O FOUR SEVEN AND THIS OBVIOUSLY CAN'T ISN'T SATISFACTORY AS PEROMETERS FOR THE BUTTERWORTH FILTER WHY IS THAT THE REASON IS
 THAT
