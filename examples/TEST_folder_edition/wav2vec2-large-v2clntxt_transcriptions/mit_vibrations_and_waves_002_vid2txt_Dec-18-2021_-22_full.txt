LANDS VERY VERY SIMILAR BETWEEN THE TWO WAVES RIGHT SO THEREFORE WHAT I AM GOING TO DO IS THAT I AM GOING TO ASSOON K ONE IS VERY CLOSE TO K TWO
 IS ROUGHLY K OK AND I M GOTO END BECAUSE OF THIS SINCE I HAVE A CONTINUOUS FUNCTION IF K Y IS RELLY CLOSE TO K TOO THAT MEANS O MAGA ONE IS GOING TO
 EALSO VERY CUSE TO OMEGA TOO RIGHT SO WHAT I AM GOING TO GET IS OMEGA ONE IS GOING TO BE ALSO VERY SIMILAR TO OMEGA TOO AND I WILL CALL IT OMEGA OK
 SO IF I DO THIS WHEN I HAVE VERY SIMILAR K ONE ANDE K TWO WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IS THAT K ONE MINUS K TWO WILL BE
 RYSMALL SOTA MEANS A THIS VERY SMALL K MEANS LARGE WAVE LANDS THEREFORE THIS COSINTEN WILD BECOME THEENVE
 BECAUSE THE SAY SE ARE SLOWLY BARITING A EMPERTU AS A FUNCTION OF POSITION BECAUSE A CASE VERY SMALL CASE CASE MALMEANS LAND ARE LARGE THEREFORE THEM
 DU IS GOING TO BE HAVING THIS MODULATION WHICH IS SATA LIKE A ENVELOPE HE TE THE SPEED OF THIS ENVELOPE THE OSCILLATION OF THIS ENVELOPE IS AS YO CONTRO BY THEK OK
 LAT LOOK AT THE LAPAN SITEN K ONE PROS K TWO OVER TWO IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE CALCULATING THE AVRAGE OF THE FIRST AND SECOND OF THE WAVE NUMBER OF THE FIRST AND SECOND WAVES RIGHT SO YOU WILL
 CLAT AVERAGE IT CAN BE STILL PETY LARGE THEREFORE YOU HAVE SMALL LONDE RIGHT COMPARED TO THE DIFFERENCE THEREFORE YOU SEE THAT TA I SHOUL CONTRIBUTE TO THOSE LITTLE STRUCTURES IN
 IN INDISCREPENT CALLED CARRIER YES TATAS
 SO THEY CAN BE DIFFERENTI THOUGHT Y SOSO YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IHT SO YOU CAN YOU CAN PRODUCEA SOME SOMETHING LIKE A CARRIER AA EVEN WHEN KINE IS NOT EQUAL TO K TWO RIS IS JUST AT EVERY RIT YOUARE RIGHT
 BUT THE THEN THETE ON THE OTHER HAND THE DIFFERENCE KAWY AND KA TOO WILL BE ALSO LARGE THEREFORE YU I'S NOT AS EASY AS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING HERE TO IDENTIFY WHO IS THE
 EAR AND WHO IS THE ENVELOPE BUTE YOU DO YOU DO GET SOME KIND OF GRAF WHICH IS ICILLATING REALLY FAST BUT THE ENVELOPE IS GOING TO APPER ALSO ICILLATING REALLY FAST THAT IS HARDER TOO TO SEE AL THE STRUCTURE BUT
 YOUR ABSOLUTELY RIGHT YES VERY GOOD QUESTION SO NOW I HAVE THIS SET UP I ASSUME THAT THEY ARE VERY CLOSE TO EACH OTHER SO NOW I CAN DEFINE FACE VELOCITY FINALLY
 WITH DEFINE WHAT IS I U THE FACE OF VELOCITY THE FACE O VELOCITY I CALL IT V P YOU CAN SEE THAT BEFORE I ALREADY HAVE BEEN USING FACE VELOCITY V P FOR THE PREVIOUS
 ASTIONS THAT IN THE CASE OF NON DISPERSIVE MEDIUM THE FACE VELOCITY IS JUST A B P WHICH IS THE VELOCITY IN THE EQUATION AND IN THIS CASE B P WOLD BE EQUAL TO OR MAGA O
 AS WE DISCUSS EFOR LAS AT THE DEFINITION OF THIS FACE VELACITY O K AND I CAN NOW ALSO DEFINE THE GOVELOCITY OK
 GROUP VELOCITY E SAY SHOULDBE THE VELOCITY OF THE ENVELOPE OK I CAN CALCULATE THE VELOCITY OF THE ENVELOPE RIGHT IN THE CASE OF FACE VELOCITY I ANT CALCULATING
 THE VELOCITY OF THE CARRIER OK AM TAKING A RATIO OF THE AVERAGE AND THE I TE AVERAGE IS SO CLOSE TO K AND OBEGA THEREFORE THE FACE VELOCITY V P WOULD TEACH US THE SPEED OF THE PROBLICATION
 OF THE CARIE WHICH IS A OMEGAB K I CALL IT B P AND IN CASE OF GROUP VELOCITY I CALL IT B G B G IS DESCRIBING THE SPEED OF PROPAGATION OF THE ENVELOPE THEREFORE
 WHAT I'M GETTING IS OMEGA ONE MINUS OMEGA TWO OK TVI DEPI ONE MINUS K TWO POS OP AND HAVE A EFFECT OF ONE OVER TWO LIKE WHICHA
 CEN SOT RI AND WHEN THEY ARE REALLY SO CLOSE TO EACH OTHER THIS IS A SEL ROUGHLY LIKE THE OMEGA AND THE QUESTION SO FAR
 SO WE HAVE DERIVED TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF SPEED ONE IS ACT RELATED TO THE FACE OF ALACITY WHICH ONE IS A ONE IS ATLY CALLED
 VELOCITY IS RELATED TO THE SPEED OF THE CARRIER OK THE OTHER ONE IS CRO VELOCITY WHICH ISENTLLY RELATED TO THEE SPEED OF THE ENVELOPE OK SO DA ME DISQUIDE YOU
 ARE INTERESTING INTERESTING EXAMPLES AND THE S WAKI WALT WE CAN NELY LEARN FROM THIS IN THE FIRST EXAMPLE I AM WALKING ON A NON DISPERSIVE MEDIAM OK IF I HAVE
 NON DISPERSIVE MEDIAN O K THEN PASTE WHAT IAM GOING TO GETIA OMEGA WILL BE PROPORTIONALE TO
 K IF I PRAT OMEGA VERSUS K IS A STRAIGHT LINE OK NOW IF I HAVE OMEGA I CHOOSE THE OMEGA OF THE TWO OMEGA WAN OMEGA TO
 THE TWO WAVES TO BE ROFTY EQUAL TO OMECA DIRO OK I CAN NOW EVALUATE THE V P THE V P WILL BE ER THE SLOPE RIGHT OF THE
 OF THIS POINT THE SLOPE OF A LINE CONNECTING THE TERO TO THAT POINT RIGHT WHICH SAY TO THE OMEGA OF BE CARI SO THAT ISU THE DEFINITION OF THE FASE VELOCITY IGET THIS SLOPE
 THIS IS THE SLOPE OF THIS THIS LINE ESSENTIALLY CALLEDEREATED TO THE FACE VELOCITY OK I CAN ALSO CALCULATE THE SLOPE OF A LINE CUT TO THIS POINT
 BUT I SHOULD CUT THROUGH TIS DESET TIS CURVE AND IN THIS CASE I AM ALSO GOING TO GET A LINE OVERLAPPING WITH FACE VELOCITY BECAUSE IN THIS CASE OMAGA OVER
 IS THE CONSTENT WHICH IS V THEREFORE IF NO MATTER WHAT YOU CALCULATE IF YOU CALCULATE V P AS A RATIO OF OMEGA AND HE K WOR YOU CALCULATE V G WHICH IS AS THE SLOW
 E LINE CUTTING THROUGH THAT POINT YOU ALWAYS GET GET AS YE BE OK THEREFORE WHAT WE LEARN FROM HERE IS THAT FOR A NON DISPERSIVE MEDIAN V P WILL BE EQUAL TO
 G OK NOW MEANS POST OF THIS A TWO CURVES POST OF THE CURVE OF A ENVELOPE DESCRIBING THE ENVELOPE AND DESCRIBING THE CARRIER
 IS GOING TO BE PROPAGATING AT E SANE SPEED ANY QUESTIONS SO THE WHOLE THING IS GOING TO BE MOVING AT A CONSTANT SPEED FOR THAT I CAN NOW SHOW YOU
 SOME EXAMPLE WHICH I PREPARED A SIN SIMULATION WHICH I PREPARED
 K SEE SO WHAT HE DOES IS THAT IT REALLYO WITH A SECOND DIS IS
 BIDZIRO OK SO THIS IS THE CASE WHEN I HAVE A NON DISPERSIVE MEDIUM OK IF I HAVE A NON DISPERSIVE MEDIUM WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IS THAT BOS THAT IS A POSTER LA CARRIER
 WHICH IS THE SPEED OF THE AUDO'S LITTLE STRUCTURE AND THE ENVELOPE IS GOING TO BE PROPAGATING AT TE SENT SPEED SO YOU CAN SEE THE HIG IS LIKE A FIXED PATTERN IS PROPAGATING TOWARD THE RIGHT HAND SIDE AND TH THE RELATIVE MOTION
 BETWEEN THE FINE STRUCTURE AND THE ENVELOPE I SAT DERO SOPESI YOU HAVE EXACTLY THE SAME PATTERN AS A FUNCTION OF TIME OK SO NOW I AMT GOING TO MOVE FROM AWAY FROM THE NON DISPERSIVE MEDIUM
 HOW ABOUT WE DISCUSS WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF WE HAVE CONSIDER THE STIFFNESS OF THE STRING AND SEE WHAT WE GET FROM THERE SO IF I BROUGHT OMEGA
 AS A FUNCTION OF K O K AND THE CONSIDER AFA TO BE NON ZERO IS A POSITIVE VALUE SO IF I HAVE AFA TO BE A POSITIVE VALUE NON ZERO O K
 IN THIS CASE IAM GOING TO GET A CURVE LIKE THIS OK THE SLOPE IS SENTIALLY A CHANGING AND BECAUSE IT'S A CURVING DOWN IT'S CUVING UP BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE K LARGE
 THEN YOU WIL SEE THAT THE E RATIO OF OMEGA AND K AS TO INCREASE SO TOT ISSENTIALLY THE KIND OF CURV WHICH WE WOULD GET IF I SET THE OMEGA OF THE FIRST AND SECOND
 A WAF IN THE OF OF INCREST IN THIS STUDY TO BE OMEGADIRO NEBESITY WHAT YOU AREGOING TO GET IS THAT O K NOW I HAVE THIS POINT HERE UNDER CUFF OK IF I
 CALCULATE THE FACE VELOCITY THE FACE O VELOCITY HOW DO I CALCULATE THAT I CAN NOW CONNECT ZERO AND THAT POINT BY A LINE OK AND I CAN NOW CALCULATE
 LOPE OF THIS LINE AND I CAN GET THE AFACE VELOCITY VP OK ON THE OTHER HAND I CAN ALSO CALCULATE A THE SLOPE OF A LINE CUTTING
 THROGH TANGENTIAL TO TE THE POINT OF INTEREST OK AND THAT IS GOING TO GIVE ME A GOOD VELACITY O K AS YOU CAN SEE FROM HERE WHICH SLOPE IS AS YOU LARGER
 ANYBODY KNOW KENAAND POINTED OUT GROP VELOCITY IS LARGER RIGHT SO IN THIS CASE IF I TURN ON A FAR GREATER THAN ZERO WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IS THAT SINCE THE CRUP VELOCITY IS LARGER THAN
 THE FACE VELOCITY THAT MEANS IF I GO BACK TO THAT PICTURE OK THE ENVELOPE IS GOING TO BE MOVING FASTER THEN THE FINE STRUCTURE INSIDE THE ENVELOPE HOW ABOUT WE TAKE A FIVE
 BREAK OM FROM HERE AND WE CONTINUE DISCUSSION AFTER BREAK WECAS A GOOD TIME TO TAKE AFREGHTO WELCOME BACK EVERYBODY SO WE WILL CONTINUE THE DISCUS
 ON OF THE PIT PHENOMENA SO WHAT WE HAVE SHOWN YOU IS THAT A PACE ON THOSE CURVES AS WE CANNESWIT DETERMINING WHAT WILL BE THE RELATIVE VELOCITY OF THE A OF THE
 WHAT WHAT WOULD BE THE VELOCITY OF TE THE CARRIER WHICH I SAY SOULD BE DENOTED BY AM T P AND THE WHAT WOULD BE THE VELOCITY OF THE ENVELOPE WHICH I SAY SULLY DENOTED
 BY A LAGRUPLOSITY O IM ENDING IN THE IN THIS CASE WHAT ITO BE PARTING HERE IS THAT IN THIS CASE BECAUSE ARFAISETALY GREATER THAN ZERO
 THEREFORE THIS A CUFISASOE A CURVING UP THEREFORE YOU HAVE LARGER A GROVELOCITY COMPARED TO THE FACE VELOCITY SO WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT IS THAT THE EMB
 LOP IS GOING TO BE ACTUALLY PROGRESSING AT A SPEED HIGHER THAN THE SPEED OF A THE LA CARRIER OK ON THE OTHER HAND IF MANGICODE OK I CAN
 CONSTRUCT SOME KIND OF A MEDIAN WHICH CAN BE HISQUIVE IN WHICHI THE SITUATION ARE FAR SMALLER THAN DERON WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN SO IF I PROT THAT IF I PROT
 ATION WICH AFA SMALLER THAN TERO SO AND THE NOW I PROT OMEGA WAS THE FUNCTION OF K WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN JUST LIKE THIS TOPACITY YOU HAVE SOMETHING WHICH ISH IS RECURVIG
 DAN O K SO IF I NOW AGAIN WALK ON SOME POINT OF INTEREST HERE O K YOU CAN SEE THAT THESLO
 POF THE FACE VELOCITY IS NOW IT SHOULD BE AH THE SLOPE OF THE THE FACE VELOCITY IS NOW AT SHOULD BE LARGER THAN THE SLOPE WHICH IS ASUALLY A
 LINE CUTTING THROUGH THEE TANGENT TO THE THE CUF WHICH SAE ARE GETTING YOU THE GRUPLASY SO IN THE CASE OF AFAS MOR THEN ZERO
 WHICH IS SON STRANGEA AMEDIUM WHICH I CAN CREATE FROM WHAEVER PASMA OR SOME REATY A STRANGE A KIND NEW KIND OF MATERIAL OF INTEREST IF THAT HAPPENS THEN THAT MEANS YOU WERE A GRUP
 CITY WILL BE SMALLER THAN DUG THE FACEELACETY OK AND IF YOU LOOK AT THIS POINT HERE YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS CURVE ATO THE
 A MEXIMMAN HERE ANDE IF YOU ESUDY ARE OPERATING AT THIS POINT WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IS THAT IF YOU CALCULATE THE GROUP
 CITY WOL BET ABOUT O YOU'LL BE TERON WHAT DOES THAT MEAN THAT MEANS THE ENVELOPE WILL NOT BE MOVING ALONG OK BUT THE THE THE CARRIERS ARE STILL MOVINGO
 SINDEED AT THIS POINT YOU ARE GAY GOING TO GET GOD VOLOCITY EQUAL TO ZER OK AND FINALLY IF YOU ASHOD
 GOING TO A VERY LARGE CA VALUE IN THIS SCENEREO AFA SMALLER THAN ZERO YOU SEE THAT EVEN YOU CAN HAVE FACE VELOCITY B P
 POSITIVE BECAUSE HE SAYS Y A POSITIVE SLOPE AND ADUT VELOCITY AE IS NEGATIVE WHY WHAT DOES THAT MEAN NAI MEANS YOUA
 GOIN TO SEE A SITUATION THAT THE CARIERS ARE PROGRESSING IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION AND THE A THE THE ENVELOPE IS GOING TO BE A
 PROGRESSING IN THE NEGATIVE DIRECTION PROBIC FOQUESSING TO THE NEX LAPPING SIDE OF THE PORT SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN THAT MIANS THIS WAVE IS DOING
 WHAT MICHAEL JESSON IS DOING LIES ESENTIALLY TWEN EH SO THIS ISSENTIALLY THE KIND OF THING WHICH COULD HAVE HAPPENED THAT IT LOOKS LIKE THAT
 ARE YOU ARE DOING YOARE GOING FORWARD BECAUSE ALL THE AR CARRIERS ARE MOVING IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION BUT THE BODY E SAYSOY GOING TO EARTH
 NEGATIVE DIRECTION OK MAYBE I CAN ALSO LEARN MOON WORK AT SOME POINT OK SO THAT'S GO BACK TO THE DEMONSTRATION WHICH I GOT STARTED AND SOMEHOW I GOT MEED UP A
 SO LETS TAKE A LOOK AT THE DETEMO AGAIN SO TAS LOOK AT ALL THE DIFFERENT SITUATION AT ONCE SO IN THIS CASEF US WE DISCUSSED BEFORE THIS ISSENTIALLY HAPPENING IN THE
 NON DISPERSIVE SITUATION TAT IN THIS SITUATION YOU HAVE A STRAIGHT LINE NON DISPERSIVE MEDIAN AS WE GIVE YOU ALWAYS THE GROP VELOCITY EQUAL TO A FACE VELOCITY OK SO
 IMEANS THE CARRIER AND THE A THE ENVELOPE IS GOING TO BE MOVING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AT THE SAME AS A SPEED OK ON THE
 HEHAND IN THIS CASE WE CAN ACTUALLY HAVE A SITUATION THAT THE THE FACEO VELOCITY ESSENTIALLY FASTER THAN THE GROUP VELOCITY O SO WHAT I MEAN IS THAT SILA SITUATION HERE
 FACE VELOCITY CALCULATED FROM A LINE CONNECTING FROM ZERO TO THAT POINT O IS ACTUALLY HAVING A LARGER SLOPE COMPARED TO THE TENGENTRA LINE AND YOU YOULL SEE THIS SITUATION SO BESY DO YOU SEE THAT
 INSIDE THE ENVELOPE ALL THOSE CARRIERS ARE ACTUALLY MOVING FASTER THAN THE ENVELOPE NOW I CAN HAVE A DISPERSIVE MEDIUM WHERE
 LACO VELOCITY IS SEQUEL TO TERO SO WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IS THAT REALLY THE ENVELOPE ESSETALLY NOT MOVING IS NOT LIKE LAKE THIS EH BUT THA THE PARTY IS NOT MOVING RIGHT SO YOU HAVE SUNG
