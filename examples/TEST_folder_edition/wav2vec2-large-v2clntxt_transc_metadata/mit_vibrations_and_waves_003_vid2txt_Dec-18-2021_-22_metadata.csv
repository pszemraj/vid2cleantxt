MIT_VibrationsAndWaves003.mp4,54,15,13.5,Dec-18-2021_-22,"CARRIESINSI THIS IN THIS IN THE STRUCTURE ESENTIALLY MOVING FORWARD BUT THE ENVELOPE ESSENTIALLY NOT MOVING
 SO FINALLY THE LAST SITUATION IS REALLY INTERESTING SO TAMIN IN THIS SITUATION THIS ISSANTIAL TE A HEAVY LACUBELOCITY A
 THE GROP VELOCITY IS ACTUALLY HAVING DIFFERENT SIGN COMPARED TO THE FACE VELOCITY SO YOU CAN SEE THAT THA THE WHOLE STRUCTURE OF THE ENVELOPE IS SANTIALLY MOVING BACKWARD BUT THAT THECAR
 ESPENCIALLY MOVING IN THE POSITIVE DIRECTION IN THIS EXAMPLE OK SO THIS ESPENTIALLY WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED FROM TE FROMTIS
 BIT PHENOMENA AND WE HAVE COVERED UP THE IDEA OF FACE VELOCITY AND HE GROUP VELOCITY SO HOW ABOUT FOUNDE CYSTEM HOW DO WE UNDERSTAND WHEN WE HAVE ABOUNDE SYSTEM
 HOW DOES THAT INVOLVE EVOLVE AS A FUNCTIONAL TIE SO IF I HAVE A SISTEN OF TWO WALLS AND THE ONE STRING AND OF COURSE I GIVE YOU THE DENSITY FOR DEINY LANDS AND
 THE TENT STRING TENSION AND ALSO THE AFA WHICH S AS WE TELL YOU ABOUT THE STEEPNESS OF THI SISTER OK AGAIN I CAN WRIDE DOWN SISTE TO BE
 SONG OF ORDER NO MORE MO FROM ONE TO INFINITY A M SIN K M X PAS AFM SIN
 ANT APAT AND THEN WHAT WE CAN DO IS THAT WE CAN FIRST GET THE INITIAL CONDITIONS OF THIS SYSTEM AND
 O THE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS OF THIS SYSTEM THEN WE AS JUST FOLLOW EXACTLY THE SAME PROCEDURE TO OBTAIN ALL THE UNKNOWN COEFFICIENTS THEN WE'LL BE ABLE TO EVOLVE THIS SYSTEM AS A FUNCTIONAL TIME AS I HAVE DEMONSTRATED YOU IN THE BEGINNING
 LECTURE SO IN THIS CASE YOU CAN HAVE TWO BOUNDARY CONDITIONS ONE ESESALLY AT X EQUAL TWO ZERO AND THE OTHER ONE IS ATE AT X EQUAL TO L O IN THOSE BOUNDARIES
 WE AS YE LEARNED BEFORE BECAUSE THE END POINTS ARE FIXED ON THE WALL THEREFORE SI OFTERO AT THE AT THE TIME T WILL BE ALWAYS
 EQUAL TO ZERO FOR THE LAFAND SI A PONDARY CONDITION AND THE VERY SIMILARDY AS WE DISCUSSED BEFORE SF L T WILL BE EQUAL TO ZERO IF YOU LOOK AT THE RIGHTAD SIDE OF THE WALL
 OF THE SISTER O SO I DON'T WANT TO REPEAT THIS BECAUSE THIS IS ATO EXACTLY THE SAME CALCULATION WHICH WE HAVE DONE BEFORE IGHT SO WITH THIS CONOND TIS TWO PONDARY CONDITIONS WE CAN ETU CONCRUDE AT
 M WILL BE EQUAL TO M PI OVER L AND THE F N WILL BE EQUAL TO ZERO OK SO YOU CAN ISSU GO BACK AND THE CHECK THIS
 A RESULT SO WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS THAT UNTIR NOW WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING IS IDENTICAL TO WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING FOR THE NON DISPRESSIVE MEDIUM O K WHAT I'M TO SAY IS THAT THE
 P THE NOMA MO IS ATESET BY THE BOUNDARY CONDITION IS DETERMINED BY THE BOUNDARY CONDITION AND IT HAS ACTUALLY SO FAR NOTHING TO DO WITH THE THE DISPERS
 RELATION O MAGA IS A FUNCTIONO OK SO SO IN SHORT BOUNDARY CONDITION CAN GIVE YOU THE SHAPE OF THENORMAL MOTE AND WE KNOW THAT THE FIRST NORMAL MO SECOND NORMAL MO ET CETERA ET CETERA
 ESAYIALLY AA GOING TO BE IDENTICAL TO THE CASE OF NON DISPERSIVE MEDIUM O K SO THAT AS BE THE FIRST THING WHICH WE LEARN THE SECOND THING WE LEARN IS THE O K NOW
 WHAT WE SEE IS THAT ONCE THE BOUNDARY CONDITION IS GIVEN THEN THE KN IS SA TO BE ALSO GIVEN THEREFORE SINCE I HAVE THE DISPERSION RELATION OMEGA AS A FUNCTIONAL K
 ASJON THER RIGHT OMEGA IS EQUAL TO OMEGA BOQS EQUAL TO V TIMES SQUARED TO THE ONE PROS OFA SQUARE RIGT THEREFORE HENCE K N IS GIVEN OMEGA
 IS ALSO GIBEN SO YOU CAN SEE THAT THAT'S AS SE WER THE DISPERSION RELATION COMING TO PRAY THE OMEGA AN
 BET DIFFERENT IF YOU COMPARE THE DISPERSIVE CASE AND NOT DISPERSIVE CASE OK SO THAT IS A TO BE ER WHAT I WANT TO SAY THE K N WHICH IS THE SHAPE OF THE NORMAL MOLE DOESN'T DEPEND
 ON THE DISPERSION RELATION ON THE OTHER HAND THE SPEED OF THE OSCILLATION THE ANGURAR FREQUENCY O MEGA DEPENDS ON THE DISPERSIAN RELATION WHICH ESPECIALLY WHILE WE ABTAINED IT FROM
 IF I START TO PROT OMEGA AND AS THE FUNCTION OF
 SO IN THE CASE OF NON DISPERSIVE MEDIUM SO WHAT I AM GOING TO GET IS I SHOULDBE DISCRETE POINT ALONG A STRAIGHT LINE OK TISSOE K ONE
 TOFOUR ETCETERA THERE I SOUE THERE ISHOULD BE ALL SITTING ON A COMMON STRAIGHT LINE OK IF YOU DO GETTE LOK TEOO
 TIVE AS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN K ONE K TWO AND K THREE THEY ARE CONSTANT ACCORDING TO THIS FORMULA THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN K Y AND K TWO IS PI OVER TWO K TWO AND K THREES ALSO POVER TWO
 ERL IS ALWAYS A FIXED NUMBER AND THE SING OMEGA ESSENTIALLY PROPORTIONAL TO K THEREFORE THE SPACING BETWEEN OMEGA ONE OMEGA TWO OMEGA
 THREE IS ALSO CONSTANT OK IN SHORT OMEGA TO OMICA TRE AND OMIGA FOUR ET CETERA IS ALWAYS A MULTIPLE TINES OF VAE
 GET FROM OMAKA ONE RIGHT ACCORDING TO A DISE QUAR AND IN THE CASE OF NONE DISPERSIVE MEDIUN OK SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN NO MEANS O K NOW IF I HAVE
 A VERY COMPLICATED INITIAL CONDITION OK THIS ESETALLY WHAT I HAVE AN INITIAL CONDITION VERY COMPLICATED OK I JUST NEED TO WAIT IF THIS IS ASURE NON DISPERSIVE MED
 THAT I JUST HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL T EQUAL TO TWO PI OBE OMEGA ONE THEN THIS SYSTEM WOULD RESTORED TO ITS ORIGINAL SHAPE O CASE A SAY TOB WHAT I CAN LEARN FROM HERE
 BECAUSE O MAKE OUT TWO OR MAKE OUT THREE AND ANY HIGHER OTHER A NO MORE MODES THE ANGR FREQUENCY SAY SHE MULTIPLY TIMES OF WHAT I GET FROM OR MAKE OUT ONE O K
 ON THE OTHER HAND IF I CONSIDER THE SITUATION OF THISPERSIVE MEDIUM OK YOU CAN SEE THAT NOW NOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
 O MEGA N IS NOW THE CONSTANT OK SO WHILE YOU WERE PRODIGOUS THAT IT WOULD TAKE MUCH MUCH LONGER FOR THIS SYSTEM TO GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL SHAPE COMPARED TO ER ER
 NON DISPERSIVE MEDIUM O CAS OR NOT IS WHETHER YOU CAN AS YOU SEE IN INA REAL LIFE A EXPERIMENT I CAN DISTORT THIS IT THIS EQUIPMENT IN THIS BOUNDS AS A SISTEN AND IS
 GOING TO TAKE FOREVER WOR IMPOSSIBLE TO COME BACK TO THE ORIGINAL SHAPE BECAUSE OF THE DISPERSIONO ON THE OTHER HAND IF I HAVE T REALLY HIGHLY IDEALIZED THE SITUATION IF I HAVE BOS AND BOUND AND I JUST HAVE
 WAIT UNTIL T EQUAL TO TWO PI OVER OR MAKE OT ONE THEN THIS SYSTEM WILL GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL SHAPE BEFORE I END THE THE LECTURE TO DAY K
 I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS WITH YOU TOO INTERESTING ISSUE SO MANY OF YOU HAVE SEEN WATER WAVES EH AND FIRMANT AS YOU TOLD US IN
 LECTURE THAT WATER WAVES ARE THE ARE REALLY EASILY SEEN BY EVERYBODY BUT I SAYS SOUE THE WORST POSSIBLE EXAMPLE THAT'S THE BAD NEWS THE WORST POSSIBLE EXAMPLE BECAUSE IT HAS ALL THE POSSIBLE
 ER THAT WAVES CAN HAVE THAT'S THE BAD NEWS THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO THAT IN YOUR PIAED SO WE WERE BIBL TO UNDERSTAND THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE WATER WAVESSAID
 THA GOOD NEWS THE SECOND THING WHICH I WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IS FACE VELOCITY OK YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS OK YOU CAN SAY O K YOU SAY THAT FACE VELOCITY OR HARMONICA WAVES DONTSEND
 INFORMATION RIGHT AND AND TE HOW DO I A SO KNOW THAT RIGHT SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN O K SO LET'S TAKE THIS HORRIBLE EXAMPLE OF WATE WAVE OK S SOTELE THE BLACK LINE IS ASU E
 BEACH AND TEYOU THERE'S A WATER WAVE PON THE OCEAN APPROACHING THE BEACH AND YOU CAN SEE THAT YOU CAN HAVE SOME KIND OF ANGLE BETWEEN THE INCERTANT WATER WAVE AND THE LINE OF THE BEACH OK
 AH WHAT I CAN NEASELY DO IS THAT I CAN NOW MEASURE THE SHAPE OF THEWATER WATER WAVE AT AT THE EDGE OF BEACH AND THE WERY
 SEE THAT HA NOW THE LEFACE VELOCITY WHICH I OBSERVE THERE ESENTIALLY FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF A PROPAGATION OF THE WATERWAY BECAUSE OF THIS THIS
 INSIDE THE ANGLE OK I CAN ASLY MAKE IT VERY VERY FAST I CAN MAKE THIS SPEED ISHAB EVEN FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT RIGHT
 I CAN I CAN I CAN NOW DECREASE THE THE SITA TO ZERO THEN YOU HAVE YOU HAVE A FACE VELOCITY WHICH IS FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT IT GO TO INFINITY
 BUT DOES THAT MEAN ANYTHING ISE THAT DOEDNOT MEAN ANYTHING BECAUSE THATI DON'T REALLY MOVE WITH WATER FROM A SPECIFIC POINT TO ANOTHER POINT INFINITELY FAST
 THEREFORE WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS THAT OK YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO MAKE A FANCY FACE VELOCITY BUT THAT WILL NOT HELP YOU WITH SENDING THINGS COSE TO THE SPEED OF LIGHT OR GREATE SPEED OF
 OK SO AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE EXAMPLE I CAN EASILY CONSTRUT A SIMPLE EXAMPLE WHICH YOU SEE THAT IS THAT SE IS REALLY NOT SENDING ANYTHING FROM ONE PRESS TO THE OTHER BUT YOU STILL HAVE A READIRLLY FAST F
 I OKI THANK YOU VERY MUCH EVERYBODY FOR THE ATTENTION AND THE WHOOF YOU ENJOY THA LECTURE AND IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS A ESTAME
