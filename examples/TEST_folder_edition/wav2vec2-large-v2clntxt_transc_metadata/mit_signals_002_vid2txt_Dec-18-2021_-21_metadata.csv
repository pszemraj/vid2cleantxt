MIT_Signals_002.mp4,21,15,5.25,Dec-18-2021_-21,"THE FILTHE FILTER THAT WE OBTAINED BY MAPPING THE BUTTERWORTH FILTER TO A DIGITAL FILTER THROUGH THE BIOLINEAL TRANSFORMATION IN FACT FALLS OFF IN FREQUENCY
 MUCH MORE RAPIDLY THAN THE ONE THAT WE GOT THROUGH IMPULSE AND VARIANCE A QUESTION IS WHY NOW ONE THOUGHT THAT MIGHT COME TO MIND AS WELL IMPULSE AND VARIANCE AS ALIASING THE BIOLINEAR TRANSFORM
 AN DOESN'T HAVE ALIASING THAT MUST BE A CONSEQUENCE OF ALIASING IN FACT THAT'S NOT THE REASON ALIASING AS IT TURNS OUT IN THIS PARTICULAR DESIGN IS WA WAS RELATIVELY MINIMAL IN THE IMPULSE AND VARIANT DESIGN
 THE REASON HAS TO DO WITH THIS NON LINEAR MAPPING IN THE BILINEAR TRANSFORMATION FROM THE CONTINUOUS TIME FREQUENCY TO THE DISCREET TIME FREQUENCY KEEP IN MIND THAT
 THROUGH THAT MAPPING AS YOU START WALKING AROUND THE UNIT CIRCLE AND MOVING UP THE JEOMEGA AXIS AS YOU MOVE UP THE JEOMEGA AXIS YOU HAVE TO MOVE FASTER AND FASTER AND FASTER AND FASTER AND WHAT'S IN
 NOUS TIME FREQUENCY AND INFINITY IS WHAT YOU GET TO IN THE DISCREET TIME FREQUENCY BY THE TIME YOU GET AROUND TO PI SO IN FACT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS AS AS WE LOOK OUT ALONG THIS
 QUENCY AXIS IS WE'RE SEEING HIGHER AND HIGHER AND HIGHER FREQUENCIES IN THE CONTINUOUS TIME FILTER BY THE TIME WE GET TO PI WE SHOULD IN FACT BE IN THE CONTINUOUS
 TIME FILTER EQUIVALENTLY OFF TO INFINITY WHICH SOUNDS LIKE A PRETTY UNCOMFORTABLE PLACE TO BE O K NOW THIS WAS A FAIRLY RAPID TRIP
 RO A NUMBER OF ISSUES IN PARTICULAR SOME OF THE ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE BIOLINEAR TRANSFORMATION AND ALSO THIS ISSUE OF HOW YOU PICK THIS PEROMETER CAPITAL T AND HOW IT MIGHT BE
 TED WITH A SAMPLING FREQUENCY IF YOU'RE DOING DISCREET TIME PROCESSING OF CONTINUOUS TIME SIGNALS AND WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO EXPLORE SOME OF THOSE ISSUES MORE FULLY IN THIS LECTURE BUT I'D LIKE
 CONCLUDE BY MAKING A COUPLE OF COMMENTS ONE COMMENT IS THAT THE TWO TECHNIQUES THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IMPULSE AND VARIANCE AND THE BIOLINEAR TRANSFORMATION ARE THE TWO TECHNIQUES THAT ARE PRINCIPALLY USED
 AND ONE THINKS OF MAPPING CONTINUOUS TIME FILTERS TO DISCREET TIME FILTERS FOR WHATEVER APPLICATION AND I STRESS AGAIN THAT YOU MAY WANT TO DO THAT MAPPING WHETHER OR NOT THE DISCREET TIME FILTER
 IS EVENTUALLY GOING TO BE USED FOR PROCESSING CONTINUOUS TIME SIGNALS NOW IMPULSE AND VARIANCE HAD THE CHARACTERISTIC THAT IT VERY NICE CHARACTERISTIC THAT THAT
 CORRESPONDS TO A LINEAR MAPPING BETWEEN THE TWO FREQUENCY AXES EXCEPT FOR THE ISSUE OF ALIASING AND THAT'S A PROBLEM WITH IT AND IN PARTICULAR LIMITS ITS USEFULNESS TO FILTER
 SIGNS OR FOR MAPPING CONTINUOUS TIME FILTERS THAT ARE BAND LIMITED ON THE OTHER HAND WE HAVE THE BILINEAR TRANSFORMATION AS A DESIGN PROCEDURE WHICH TOTALLY AVOIDS ALIOSING
 BUT HAS THE DISADVANTAGE OR DIFFICULTY THAT IT REPRESENTS A NON LINEAR MAPPING FROM THE CONTINUOUS TIME FILTER TO THE DISCREET TIME FILTER NOW THIS NON LINEAR DISTORTION IS PERFECTLY ACCEPT
 ABLE IF WE'RE DESIGNING OR ATTEMPTING TO DESIGN FILTERS THAT HAVE FLAT FREQUENCY CHARACTERISTICS IT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE IF FOR EXAMPLE WE HAD A LINEAR FREQUENCY CHARACTERISTIC THAT WE WANTED TO MAP TO A DISCREET TIME
 TER AND END UP WITH A LINEAR FREQUENCY CHARACTERISTIC IT WON'T COME OUT TO BE LINEAR BECAUSE OF THIS NON LINEAR MAPPING OF THE FREQUENCY AXES NOW THERE ARE ALSO A NUMBER OF OTHER DESIGN
 PROCEDURES WHICH WE WON'T GO INTO FOR DESIGNING DISCREET TIME FILTERS AND AMONG THEM ARE A VARIETY OF TECHNIQUES INCLUDING FOR EXAMPLE COMPUTERATED DESIGNED PROCEDURES AND I INVITE YOU
 IF YOU'RE INTERESTED AND WANT TO DIG INTO THAT IN MORE DETAIL AND MORE DEEPLY TO EXPLORE THAT TOPIC BY MAKING REFERENCE TO VARIOUS OF THE BOOKS LISTED IN THE BIBLIOGRAPHY
